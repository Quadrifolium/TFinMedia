It was reported that TFBOYS will release a brand-new mini album around Oct. 1st, with one song tailored by a top musician of Chinese music. The news raised huge concern and much conjecture. Today, the secret is unveiled, the producer of TFBOYS' new song is Jay Chou(周杰伦)!

WANG Jun-kai, the leader of TFBOYS, avowed himself a fan of Jay Chou several times before, and expressed the willingness of cooperating with him. Under the promotion of the agency, the dream now comes true! Jay would compose for them a song of school style. Moreover, the recording, the choreography, and the music video would also be made by Jay's team.

During the schedule in Taiwan days before, besides attending several TV shows, TFBOYS finished the recording of the song and the learning of the dance. Meanwhile, considerate Jay treated them with Taiwan-flavoured bubble tea, and gave them original brand clothes as presents.

One is the pop superstar of Chinese music accompanied the 1980s, the other is the national youths singing "left hand, right hand, a slow motion" -- what will this fusion bring us? This October, please stay tuned!
