Yesterday afternoon, the 2015 Teacher's New Year Art Performance of Chongqing "Ba Zhong" was held in the hall.
All the shows were created and acted by the teachers, they "acted cute and cool", while the appearance of TFBOYS WANG Jun-kai pushed the air to a new high.

**Teachers Can Be Cute**

Over ten shows were totally directed by the teachers themselves, the cute and pretty costumes, the graceful and orderly dances won much applause.
The dance music "Little Apple"(小苹果) and "Chicken Chicken"(小鸡小鸡) staged in turns, the stage play "Animal World -- The Life of 'Lao Shi'(老狮, literally: "Old Lion", sounds the same as "Teacher")" mixed serious facial expression with comical movements, expressed the hardship of teachers in humorous performance.

The self-made shows differed in styles, some are warm and romantic, some brisk and melodious, while some active and dynamic.
The teachers showed their best wishes and expectation of the New Year in dances, songs, and comedies, the excellent performances won great applause.

After watching the shows, the students were surprised at the images which differ from their serious act in class.
Xiao-cheng in junior Grade Two said, being a teacher is not easy at all, they need the students' understand.

After the excellent performances, students at school and graduated sent greetings in a video clip.

**Performance of TFBOYS WANG Jun-kai**

While the audiences were still not fulfilled, the emcee's words made their mood higher
-- "what if TFBOYS comes here?"
Then TFBOYS WANG Jun-kai came on stage, gave out the twelfth show -- greetings from students.

When music started, WANG Jun-kai in black jacket and white trousers came onto the stage, his voice caused intense cheering and applause.
Two women aged over fifty dashed to the edge of the stage, photographed with their phones without stop.

Two retired teachers were surprised at the air, while another one explained to them, "the boy is in a group which is popular around China."

WANG Jun-kai performed "The Manual of Youth" with his school fellows, and sang "Man Cheng Hua Kai"(满城花开, literally: "Flowers Blossom Around City").
At last, WANG Jun-kai stood still on the stage and said,
"this is my fourth year in 'Ba Zhong', I'm thankful to all the teachers who helped and guided me..."
