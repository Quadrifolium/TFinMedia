# TFBOYS
# THE FIRST CHAPTER
*[The title appears in P043.]*

*P042*

- For those who knew little about TFBOYS early this year, after this been fast-forwarded first half of the year, the name won't be unfamiliar for them anymore.
Maybe someone still don't know how many members are there and what their names are, but they may blurt out "Oh, that popular group?"
Yes, they are very popular, with doubts about "who are they", "why are they so popular", "what are they good at".
Among the doubts, some are simply curiousness, some are completely indifference, and some are vicious malignity.
And all these attitudes, are endured by the three boys.
- The first anniversary of their formation seemed solemn, for this was their periodic summary.
From gathering someone's focus by coverings, to the huge discussions on Hot Topics, to feeling the popularity in the events, what will they give out after "being grown", not only Clovers are waiting.
But when following their steps in a hurry, one may forget that they are the brave boys who made a "ten-year promise", while many peers of their age don't know what their dreams are.
Who dares to make a time boundary for the dream, and promises without hesitation to devote all the efforts onto the chasing road full of unknown hardships.
And the promise is not a hollow slogan, they are measuring the distance to the dream with their steady steps.
The first anniversary is to write down the first chapter of the promise, though not mature yet, but they are growing quite well, hence for the rest nine-tenth to be written, just be expected.
For one who lives 100 years, a ten-year is one-tenth of a life.
Those who are watching their growth, are you willing to take one-tenth of your life time, accompany them till the promise come true?

## Happy Smiles at the Anniversary

The popularity of TFBOYS had already been shown in front of the public at the award ceremony of "Yinyue V-Chart", and the reality is clearer with their following activities -- from the airports to the places of activities, their fans are growing geometrically.
The "Happy Smiles" appreciation party, first anniversary of debut, and release of new song held in Beijing was a formidable task, as predicted by many.
The sponsor kindly chose to host in an open space with no fee for the consideration of appreciation.
It's too good to be true, but the fact was beyond expectation.
People knew their popularity is high, but didn't know it's SO HIGH!
In order to get a number for entrance, some Clovers queued in from 3 AM.
When journalists came with their professional equipment near the time of the event, nearly 5,000 fans were crowded in the mall, and still many had to wait outside, almost 10,000 people gathered at the site.
The journalists had experienced all kinds of affairs, but this situation still surprised some of them.
This is a direct experience of "TFBOYS are so popular".

In such a place, everyone is toilsome, the three boys of TFBOYS, the staff, and the Clovers had their pressures.
But there was also a feeling of happiness flowing under the crowd, even the hot weather, the pushing stream, the worries about the proceeding of the event, tiredness of the body, anxiousness and fretfulness in the heart could not disturb it.
That was the stable step moving forward to the dream, this step belongs to all those who stood on the boundary of the anniversary.

## Actions in Progress

The theme of the appreciation party is "Happy Smile", it includes the calling on the concern about public weal, besides the mutual expression of the minds.
TFBOYS just started the first year, but they showed much concern about public weal during their boosting popularity.
They joined the event of "For CLP Children" this June, called on "for CLP children's happy smile", to deliver love and compassion.

The power of idol is huge, the effect an idol leads to is outstanding.
Following TFBOYS' calling, the Clovers responded ardently, the interaction on the topic #TFBOYS益起来#(literally: "Public Weal With TFBOYS") exceeds 900 million times,
about 370,000 yuan was raised up to the time of the anniversary, which created the record of the highest donation raised in Weibo Gongyi(微博公益, literally: "Weibo Public Weal").

Their calling doesn't stop there, the Clovers are keen on public weal.
When searching on Weibo, you'll find that the Clovers are continuously putting themselves into all kinds of activities even without TFBOYS' calling.
They raise for charity, help people in stricken areas, volunteer in organisations.
They are joking at calling themselves "aunts", but many "aunts" are still students, they are also growing in the journey of positive motivation following the idols' steps.
Growing like this is much more important than being just a typist on the net.
Bearing the outside's eyesight, TFBOYS choose to dispel the doubts using their strong calling.
Prejudices may be hard to be broken, but if we make each step firm and steady, someday when looking back, we will find that the world have changed a lot by us.

## Accompany Patiently

TFBOYS is one-year-old, we are still weak, thus we need your shoulders.
We make all our efforts for saying proudly at the ten-year promise concert at 6th Aug., 2013:
Thank you for your companionship, we have grown up.
This is our promise.
-- TFBOYS WANG Jun-kai

Ah, countdown with me -- 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Ten-year is fast, let's move on together.
-- TFBOYS WANG Yuan

I love you.
Happy birthday to us, and happy birthday to all the Clovers.
-- TFBOYS YI Yang-qian-xi

Ten-year promise, see you then!
-- Clovers

Ten-year is long, it's very courageous to make a ten-year promise;
ten-year is short, the first chapter had finished.
Every leading step is full of unknown hardships, may encounter rumours and prejudices, but after we reach the destination, the companionship will be the shinning chapter in our memories.
The past chapter cannot be replayed. On the leading road, we hope the time could be faster and faster, to let them perform on the dreaming stage earlier;
we hope the time could be slower and slower, to make the companionship longer, and longer.
