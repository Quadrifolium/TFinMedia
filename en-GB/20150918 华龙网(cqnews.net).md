He loves rock, has a band, is a certified musician on Weibo, is a trainee of TF Family since he's in Grade 6.
In this episode, we'll meet this boy who's chasing his dream of music.

Zi-yu said, among his songs, he likes "Firefly"(萤火虫) the most.
We believe that, no matter on which stage, this firefly will shine and glow continuously, and compose the wonderfulness of his own.

**TALENT**  
**Special sentiment of music from early age**

"Tune up your guitar."

"Ten minutes before getting on stage."

"Remember to bow to audience in the end."

In a music bar in Shapingba Dist., the performance was to start, HUANG Xiao-jia(黄晓嘉), the vocalist of Sui-ci(碎瓷, literally: Broken Porcelain) Band, was doing the final check.

While on the stage, a band in immature faces but professional level was performing.
The audience were swinging with the powerful music.
The band is called "Rusty Dust", the average age of the members are less than 16, while the vocalist NI Zi-yu is only 14, in Junior Grade 3 of Nankai Secondary School.

"He likes music from early age. When he's a child, he likes humming with music, though the lyrics were vague, the rhythm and the pitch were precise." Zi-yu's mother said.

NI Zi-yu learns piano from 7, it was initially for the grading only.
"Practising the designated sheets again and again, day after day, it made me feel dull."
NI said, music must not be dull.
Later, he encountered HUANG Xiao-jia of Sui-ci Band.
With his advice and leading, NI started performing with his fellows, started "playing" music.
He found the pop and rock more interesting, and began the discipline in guitar and keyboard since 10.

**CHANCE**  
**Joining TF Family, being fellow of TFBOYS**

In October 2012, like WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan, NI Zi-yu was recruited by TF Family as a trainee, and signed contract with the agency in March 2014.

"As a trainee, the agency provides professional training with special vocal and physique teachers."
During the training, "discontented" Zi-yu began new attempt -- composing.

In the summer of 2013, for encouraging the drummer of the band, he composed a song called "Fighting, Drummer"(加油鼓手), which was the first song he composed himself.
"On Mother's Day last year, after coming back home, he said he has a surprise for me, and he wrote a song as the present.
I was very surprised and moved when hearing the song."
His mother said, this song is called "Carol"(颂歌).
Till now, he has composed seven songs.

Zi-yu's mother is also his teacher in school.
She is always helping and supporting him in music.
"Sometimes, when I run into bottlenecks in composing or practice, my mum enlightens me and encourages me patiently.
She's always supporting me behind, and she comes to every performance of mine." NI Zi-yu said.

**GRATITUDE**  
**Being grateful to everyone who is in favour of the music**

"A fan in Shanghai made the doll according to his looks."
"This painting is also for Zi-yu, and I mounted it." ...
Zi-yu's mother counted the presents from fans.

"I am very grateful to the fans. As I am still very young, their support and favour make me moved".
Zi-yu said, there's a supporting group for him, and he chats with the fans when he has time.
On his birthday, the fans even wrote a song for him.
Moreover, some fans from other cities come for his performance.
All these things make him moved.

These days, Zi-yu was composing a song for his school to express his regard.
He said, among his songs, he likes "Firefly" the most.
We believe that, no matter on which stage, this firefly will shine and glow continuously, and compose the wonderfulness of his own.
