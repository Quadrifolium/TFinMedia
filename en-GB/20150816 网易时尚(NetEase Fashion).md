On 15th August, TFBOYS held its fan meeting for the second anniversary, this concert-like event had gone hot due to the ticket price before.
The costumes in the event were designed and made by a post-1990 designer, Cici Wong.
NetEase Fashion interviewed this young and creative designer exclusively, and visited her "Gotcha Studio", to share the stories behind these costumes.

**Discovery of TFBOYS' costumes**
**Each one has tiny details you may not notice**

Cici designed and made over 10 costumes for this event.
As TFBOYS is a boy group, the costumes are mainly of two types: those in the same style with different patterns, and those for their solo shows.
These costumes should conform to the boys' age to express their vitality, while fashionable to suit the performances as well.

Besides, it is also important to seize their distinct personal character.
Through the costumes, it should be easy to tell who is cooler, who is more vigorous, and who is cuter.
In the current time of fans economy, the managing team also requires their personal items be added to the costumes.
All in all, it is quite a difficult task.

Cici said, the red jacket in the above photo was initially fully in red, but she sprayed with black to make it gradually changed, which wiped off the countrified feeling.
The cute patterns on the following denim jacket are in fact fabrics of different styles, which set off the young and vigorous feeling.

The next silver grey coat is in a suite, each of the boys had one.
They were completely hand-made with lambskin -- the coats are of the same style but differ in collar and other details.
As to the last costume, whom do you think was it made for?
That's WANG Yuan, the circles (sounds "yuan" in Chinese) represent the name of "Yuan" for they are homophones.
Cici said the team would like to put solid "tangyuan"(汤圆) on, but she refused, and made this distinctive smock.

**Indie designers are hard to survive**
**Studio condemn some entertainers for not paying**

Indie designers in China are harder to survive, and the challenge is not simply mocks.
Facing the rough environment, Cici said her strategy is to start from a fractionized field.

Gotcha Studio was set up by Cici and her partner two years ago, which only design performing costumes for entertainers, with costume renting and style design.
Not like others who would release series design, only entertainers are their customers.
"Gotcha" means "I've got you", Cici said, besides "to catch customer's intention", it is also "to deeply comprehend the real demand".
This target is what she and her studio urged to get.

Many entertainers have their schedules set quite late, which leaves them less time.
For example, when TFBOYS were recording "Kang-Xi Lai Le"(康熙来了, "Kang-Xi Talk Show") in Taiwan, they were told that WANG Jun-kai will attend a meeting of CYLC(the Communist Youth League of China) the next day.
(It was the meeting held in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, which WANG Jun-kai and TONG Da-wei(佟大为) attended.)
The suit was rushed out in the night, and put on in time.

However, the cooperation was not always cordial.
A partner said they had encountered two weirdos.

He said, "the team of an actor got in touch with us, and we showed that as it is the first cooperation, we may give it a try.
Because we know that it was a programme of CCTV(China Central Television), the pay might be quite low, while most expenses be put into make-up and hair-style, we won't get much on the costume.
We'd better just do it for free, as the costume would be put on for just hours.
Everything's fine if you give the costume and photos back to us.
We may charge for the following cooperation.
But at the next time, they still want it for free, because they thought he has plenty of other choices since he's famous."

He followed up with another male singer.

He said, "when we haven't moved here last year, the singer had an event, which TFBOYS also attended.
As he's in a hurry, we made his suit with everything prepared in the morning, and was waiting for them to try on.
But they didn't come.
In my opinion, promise is very important, it influences one's public praise.
It's fine to be straight if the costume doesn't suit you, but the excuse such as 'event cancelled' is easy to debunk, because the message will be publicised the next day.
I don't like such a person, and won't cooperate with them, let alone they bothered us for times.
You don't have to order us, and we can get other orders.
That is our style of behaviour.
We believe in friendship, we made costumes without advanced deposit.

**Two years in studio**
**Partners and friends deserve thanks**

Achieving all these in just two years, Cici was thankful to many people.
"'Gotcha Studio' was financially stressed out in the beginning, our friends Ms. LUO(LUO Xi, 罗茜) and Ms. GE(GE Ai-lin, 葛艾琳) helped us with over 1 million yuan's injection.
They appreciate our concept, and support our positioning of dealing in entertainers' performing costumes.
Without their support, the studio and I cannot gain the result in two years.
Ms. LUO and Ms. GE are young angel investors, their unique vision was admired by many magnates."
