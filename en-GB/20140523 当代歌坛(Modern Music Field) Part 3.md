# BOYS AND CLOVERS

Don't be fooled by their pretended maturity, they are still little boys who are often confused, naughty, struggling with homework and exams.
Don't be fooled by their immature faces, they know their target clearly and are striding forward.
It is said that the earnest is the most beautiful, how about young and earnest?
How about young, earnest, and sensible?
They are like blooming flowers of different colours, form an attracting landscape when are gathered together.
And the base of the scenery is no doubt clovers which stands for lucky.
There's no need to seize happiness around, accompany is the utmost happiness.

**WANG Jun-kai**

## Your Persistence Attracts

From been discovered and joined TF Family at 8 to been debuted as a member of TFBOYS at 13, he spent five years in toil and sweat, but also in delight and happiness.
When other children were relaxing and playing, he was perspiring and struggling;
when other children were following parents' arranging and scheduling, he was pursuing his own dream;
when other children were still unclear about future and dreams, he was already chasing the bright future with his team-mates.

When in Grade Four, Karry was found by talent scout and joined the agency.
This, brought him onto a brand-new journey.
In TF Family, he met other children who dreamed of becoming stars, and regard stars as wearing nice clothes, singing on shining stages. And so did little Karry.
But when he started training, that wonderful halo gradually faded out from his mind, he realised that it's not easy to become a star.
He received systematic training here, including dancing, which was quite difficult for a boy with no basics.
When facing leg pressing, he chose to bear the pains and managed to split with other children's help.
Several times, he was dissolved into tears, but he hung in.
In five years' time, he went to take the training every Saturday.
When asked why he's so persisted in, he said,
"this road is bound to be hard, but there's no sweet without sweat.
I will try my best to do it."
He even didn't think about a second choice, it seems right at present
-- his unthinking of other things made him dive into the training and dream that yearning dream whole-heartedly.

Later on, TF Family ran into difficulties, all other trainees left, only Karry stayed here.
Just imagine the scene, when all the friends were leaving, any child would give up.
But Karry didn't, he insisted on training, until Roy and other children came.
At that time, Karry was known and recognised on major video sites through his covers of "Qiu Niao" and "Wo Yao Kuaile".
After Roy's joining, TF Family quickly released several duets of them, including the million-hit covering video of "Yige Xiang Xiatian, Yige Xiang Qiutian", and the cover of "Dang Ai Yi Cheng Wangshi" on the anniversary of Leslie Cheung(张国荣)'s passing away.
These videos were popular among netizens, and became a medium of making more people be acquainted to the boys and to the existence of TF Family.
Karry's work was outstanding -- his covers raised people's curious about TF Family;
after this warming-up, TFBOYS came out, infused new blood into the dismal Chinese music.

Now Karry is seated in the throne once dreamed of
-- TFBOYS released albums, held signings, stood on the stage of an award ceremony in this April.
Facing the large stage and the screaming fans, Karry must have all sorts of feelings welled up in the heart
-- maybe this is the moment, that all the endeavours in the past five years turned into the easy performance today, that all the toil and sweat turned into the glory on stage.
Although it's tight in schedule, Karry know exactly what to do
-- after this award ceremony, he will throw himself into the preparation of High School Entrance Examination.
It's believed that he will get perfect scores as usual.

As for the ordinary life, Karry acts like a normal 14-year-old boy.
He likes animes, "One Piece" and "Naruto" are his favourites.
In spare time, he will play online games and do some sports.

**WANG Yuan**

## Simple "Er Huo"
*["Er Huo"(Now usually means one who's silly but cute)]*

It's hard to know when did "Er Yuan" become Roy's tag, Clovers like to use it now.
"Er" is the purity originated from one's heart, only when he's expressing himself without scruple does he reveal the actions and expressions be seen as "er".
Such a child, is usually the fancied one.

Roy joined when TF Family was in difficulties.
It is said that he and Karry became friends just because they both like Jay Chou.
When first partnered with Karry, he wore downy hairs and would wag his head with the music, looked rather lovely.
But once he started singing, you would be convinced by his tensed voice.
Roy's voice was suit for high pitch and female voice, and he performed on many large stage before as a trainee, little Roy in his childish voice looked more like a girl, is so adorable (^_^)

In "TF Teens GO!", Roy is the presenter and showed his ability of response and speech, even the Sichuanese Standard Mandarin dialect cannot hamper.
He's often bantered by others in TF Family (especially Karry!), but he will scoff back at once.
When asked "who's more handsome" in an interview, Karry said, "I am! I'm more handsome than him from head to toe. He's just cute."
The journalist said to Roy, "Karry thinks you are cute."
And Roy responded, "I think I'm cute and handsome. He's just handsome, but not cute."
And Karry could say nothing more.
At the backstage of the ceremony, when asked "who's the most popular among girls", Karry pointed at Roy and said,
"He is. Every time he came to my school, he would be surrounded by many girls."
Then Roy said, "They are all waiting to see you."
And acted like the girls with their scream, "Ah, Karry's so charming!"
Well, Roy's so witty.

"Er Yuan" often ran high in the show with no reason.
He may clap his hands and ask for applause, he may raise his hand and make a V-sign.
Seeing him acting so delighted, nobody's willing to bother (or maybe his partners were adapted to his inner world).
When were asked to open their knapsacks, he kept talking while showing his personal effects, and wore the blindfold in the knapsacks and said, "I use this when sleeping."
Before their debut, when asked how to express the emotion when covering "Dang Ai Yi Cheng Wangshi", he said,
"I pretend. I just copy what the originator did in the MV, pretend that I know the feeling, while actually I didn't."

To Roy's choice of being a trainee when so young, his mum said in proud,
"I will be the backing to whatever he likes to do, because I know he won't be changed.
He lives simple and plain, his phone is quite inexpensive, and he never compares with others on such things."
Roy's mum brought up such a nice boy, she must also be simple and kind.
Roy liked "Thomas & Friends" when he's a kid, and sees the animated film series of "Pleasant Goat And Big Big Wolf"(喜羊羊与灰太狼) every year.
These had been ridiculed by Karry many times as "only (children's) cartoons suit him", and Roy usually scoff back,
"your favourite animes goes too fast and are too complex, I prefer cartoons."

**YI Yang-qian-xi**

## Perfect Fusion of Paradoxes

What were you doing when you were fourteen?
Studying, making trouble, peeking at handsome boys or beautiful girls, starting worrying as a grown-up -- fourteen is a growing age.
This little boy was also concerned about his height, like other fourteen-year-old boys.
But except this, he makes others envious.
His experiences is not just great, but terribly astonishing, like been boosted by an unseen hand.
Don't judge him from his age, he is quite sensible and steady, which may attract you in a second.
He is good at study, but not a bookworm;
he performs well at the group's easy dance movements, but also did very well at street dance;
he may calm down when writing Chinese calligraphy, but also likes G-Dragon.
When Roy and Karry were playing, he was staring at the fish and fogs in the pool;
when others were showing new clothes with friends, he was posting his handwritings;
when you were staying with your friends, he was taking care of his younger brother.

In 2005, five-year-old Jackson stood on the stage for the first time, and got the week's champion of the show -- Qian Zong's boosting life began.
Many fans were first attracted by his dancing videos, in which his actions were powerful and to the point.
After seeing Qian Zong's dance, many fans were curious about how can he bear Two-Wang(WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan)'s gym-like movements.
In the backstage interview of the V-Chart Ceremony, Qian Zong's amiable look when Karry's showing his books for the exam revealed a mysterious eye contact between "xue ba"(学霸, one who's score ranks top in class or school).
[One sentence skipped here. I can't catch the writers thought.]
In "TF Teens GO!", "Qian-xi on the Air" held by Roy and Karry (sometimes Yu-wen[LIU Zhi-hong, a trainee of TF Family]) is not very talkative.
He didn't talk much, but listened carefully, and broke in sometimes.
(Weren't those debunking?)
Anyhow, once Qian Zong opened his mouth, you were defeated.
But watching the scenes is very enjoyable, which is worth replaying.

*[The sentences are disordered. This is mostly the script of the remade video of "Ten Years", which was released before TFBOYS attended the V-Chart Ceremony. The translation below follows the video's script.]*

> If you can look ten years forward  
What do you wish you would be  
If you can look ten years back  
What do you wish you were doing

> I am WANG Jun-kai  
I wish to be, in ten years’ time  
A great singer  
Someone see me as wasting time  
But I'm only practising when others are playing  
I was always denied  
I am still striving  
Finally, I will have  
A stage of my own  
Chasing for dream is a journey of challenge  
With sweat, toil, and tears  
But I don't care

> No matter from eight to eighteen  
Or from eighteen to twenty-eight  
We have ten years to go  
Even if failed  
We will be closer to the dream  
Don't wait  
Move on

*[Extra sentences:]*  
> When I said that I want to sing, my mum told me about her dream when she was young.

### The Start

When the 1980s' are struggling for the recognition of the public, more personalized 1990s' and 2000s' come on stage, who are more characterized by persistent and less burdened.
TFBOYS brought about unprecedented youth and vigour, they want to be recognised, they want to be closer to their dream, they want to realise it earlier.

In Jan. 2011, WANG Jun-kai was found at TF Family's winter camp.
Later, he attended the audition of "China's Got Talent" and failed.
TF Family's first EP "Wo Bu Yao Gaibian" got negative responses, brought the feeling of failure to all the children at that time.
WANG Jun-kai sang "Naxie Hua'er"(那些花儿, literally: "Those Flowers") with other leaving friends, and covered "Qiu Niao", these two song showed a bit mature of him.
He attended many shows with the cover, took TF Family away from the fringe of dissolution.
He saw WANG Yuan's joining, their covers turned TF Family to a new chapter.
At the same time, YI Yang-qian-xi joined TF Family, TFBOYS began to take shape.
Although came in halfway, YI Yang-qian-xi was already talented, the limelight on him lasts from he's only five, he excels at almost everything he did.

The dream of WANG Jun-kai, WANG Yuan, and YI Yang-qian-xi, is shining.

### Persistence

Many people cannot understand them at the first glance, they thought the dream was out of reach for children.
But from speaking out "I like singing", the dream was rooted and began sprouting, and persistence nourishes it.

In Dec. 2011, when WANG Jun-kai stood on the audition stage, he might not foresee what he will be doing now, but it seemed to make him happy.
TF Family's plan was underway but didn't went well.
All existing groups in China had a hard time, strengths were difficult to be recognised.

TF Family once wished to bear the fruit in twenty years.
But as was expected, it got hindered in 2012 -- the release of the first EP came to nothing.
The overwhelming fierce criticisms made the children cry, their hard training brought back nothing.
Many left away.
But WANG Jun-kai and other two boys stayed, kept on attending in auditions, and met WANG Yuan, whose voice fairly matched up with his.
The two had performed in the street to gain courage, sang songs that didn't match their ages, with persistence.
YI Yang-qian-xi didn't accompany them at those time, but he's also persisting.
When they met, the three finally got the chance to realise their dream, due to their persistent, which was ten years earlier than others.

### Blossom

This three boys broke the barrier of different "jigens" and led the fan-bases of East Asian idols in mainland China.
"Yinyue V-Chart" was perhaps their first appearance off the Web, the fans standing in the stadium and watching the webcast were very excited
-- they waited long for the day, they gave the boys a ten-year vision, they made a ten-year promise.
The boys' actions can easily make the fans crazy, one episode of "Study Room in Boys' School" is enough to attract them, a simple motion can be taken as screenshots frame by frame and make them cry out: "aaaaaaaaaa!", or "just can't hold it".
Because their delicate faces attracts, their blossoming's vigorous, they broke into more people's eyes.

How long will they blossom?
How long will this beautiful thing last?
The answer exists in the boys under focus - WANG Yuan, WANG Jun-kai, and YI Yang-qian-xi.

We believe that the persisted TFBOYS will keep persisting, only more endeavours are worth of those already persisted time.
They said, "even if failed, we will be closer to the dream".
