## First trainees in China born in Chongqing

We asked for the questions on our official Weibo account before this interview, the reposts and comments exceeded one thousand, made it the most active Weibo post of our account.
The music team of Lee Hyori(이효리) and Koyote(코요태/코요테) created their first EP;
thousands of fans crowded at the first public activity just two months after their debut;
during Yinyuetai's ceremony, a fan even booked the whole cyber cafe to vote for them, they got the hightest votes among mainland China groups, the fans' scream exceeded fans of other stars;
the qualification of the fans' support was approaching Korean male groups'.
The root of all these scenes was the long run of their agency started four years ago.

In 2009, WANG Jun-kai was a pupil of Panlong Elementary School, then joined Time Fengjun in the project of the agency's project of creating the first trainees in China.
10-year-old WANG Yuan joined the next year.
Now they are the most exceptional ones among those early trainees, their schools are often surrounded by fans, they become celebrities of the schools.

But it's not easy to be stars, the three boys has to get training in vocal music, dance, performance, instruments, etc. like Japanese and Korean trainees.
WANG Yuan said he "had once cried when pressing legs", but his talented voice made him more popular in the covers with WANG Jun-kai.
Their outstanding looks and complementing voices made them members of TFBOYS with YI Yang-qian-xi.


## Your Urging Questions Are Here

*[Q - NEWOO, K - WANG Jun-kai(Karry), R - WANG Yuan(Roy)]*

**Q:**
WANG Jun-kai, which senior middle school will you apply for?  
**K:**
It depends on the last exams before the application.

**Q:**
How did you express the feelings of the love songs you covered, since you have no such experience?  
**R:**
To me, there are two types of songs -- the sad and the happy.
I use the feeling of wanting to play games for the happy ones, and the feeling of getting bad scores in exams for the sad ones.

**Q:**
Are you adapted to the popularity? Is there any trouble?  
**K:**
I'm now facing the entrance exam, and under some strain as the study load is heavy.
As to the trouble -- many fans are waiting outside my school, especially in Friday afternoon, I will try to sign for them, but some fans follow me until I get home, it's not good.  
**R:**
My classmates will help to stop them, when there are too many, I will find a way to "escape".

*P31*

**Q:**
What was your feeling when seeing so many fans at the airport for the first time?  
**K:**
I was shocked at first.
Fans thought I was unhappy due to my stoned face, but I was actually shocked.

So do I, and I was ashamed.
I wore a mask as I caught a cold, but I regret it very much -- they waited a long time, I should make some talk to them.

**Q:**

**R:**
I usually go to Ba Bin Road by bike, or go to the riverside.

**Q:**
Who help whom the most in private?  
**K:**
I help WANG Yuan and Qian-xi in singing, Qian-xi helps us in dancing.  
**R:**
I help them in being cute, making jokes, and activating the air.

**Q:**
What is your favourite nickname the fans made?  
**K:**
"Xiao Kai". It's strange that some fans call me their "son".  
**R:**
It's fine to call me "Yuan-yuan" or just "WANG Yuan".
I didn't expect that some fans call me "cun hua".

**Q:**
Tell us something embarrassing of the other one.  
**K:**
One day when WANG Yuan was playing basketball, someone came and asked if he is WANG Yuan.
He denied immediately, because his clothes were awful, shoes were dirty, it's a shame to say yes.  
**R:**
He did many embarrassing things, I should keep some until he become very famous, haha.

I apologized for a long time before he forgave me.

**Q:**
What's the most intent gift you got?  
**K:**
A fan filled a book with my name.  
**R:**
I like inexpensive handmade gifts the most.

**Postscript**

At the same day of our interview, we met two fans from Wuhan intended to see them outside the building in which the agency sits, they told us their fascination excitingly -- "cute and charming", "sing well"...
The security of the building said, several groups of such fans come every day, waiting with gifts in hand.

During the interview, the two boys didn't seem spoiled or arrogant.
They acted uneasy like shy boys, didn't respond fluently like other freshmen in show biz can do.
But when talking about game, school, and leisure time, WANG Jun-kai would smile with his canine teeth, WANG Yuan would make descriptions with waving arms and smile. When referring to the future plans, their manager would take the question instead, full of scrupulous protection.
The agency, their school, and their parents, don't want the ardent fans to bother the boys' private lives.
Because they are minors, only the time under careful planing and exercise can make their sweat affecting.
