Teenager of Chang'an, riding a horse by twilight as a cavalryman. (长安美少年，羽骑暮连翩。)
Chinese eulogize chivalrous teenagers from the ancient time
-- people admire teenagers going on an expedition on a horse, to achieve success and fame.
However, the frequently seen "xiao xianrou" takes the show biz into a time filled with crazy behaviour of male consumption, which in turn makes the words "xiao xianrou" on the ambiguous edge.
Therefore, in the social networks full of erotic-like words, "three good-looking, energetic, and real boys"(comment on zhihu.com) are like a rainbow among clouds, their pure, vital, positive, and adorable character attracted loads of fans rapidly, the "teen idol time" that break through the real world and the circle of anime and video games for the first time emerged.
From the first public variety show in "Happy Camp"(快乐大本营) last May, TFBOYS have been in the sight of mainstream media for nearly a year.
This time, they were invited by the production team of cartoon "Menghuan Xiyou 2", to cooperate with Vincent Fang(方文山), record the theme song and take the model photographs.
What was it like when the boys of the "national teen group" encounter chivalrous youth in ancient costumes?
Our journalist visited the shooting site of TFBOYS' first ancient costume style exclusively, brought wonderful sidelights and an ample interview
-- Why did YI Yang-qian-xi want to travel back to the war against aggression?
How did WANG Yuan show his tenderness?
Why did WANG Jun-kai say that he's "not flirtatious, but sexy"?
How did they think about the words "xiao xianrou"? Wait and see.

**Fighting, Juniors!**
## 48 Hours After Release of "Chong'ai"
*["Chong'ai", 宠爱, literally: "Beloved" or "Cherished You")]*

Xiao-xiong, a director of Shenzhen TV, can always see some pupils dancing in the residential district she lived in.
"Follow me, left hand, right hand, a slow motion...
The lyrics and rhythms are very addictive, I can sing it on my own."
She appreciated the girls' concentration, but complained about the too "concentrated" choice of the song.
In the afternoon of 20th Mar., she found the girls changed the song, the singer was the same group, the lyrics and rhythms were still sweet.
Xiao-xiong searched the rhythms using her mobile, and found out that this was the new song of TFBOYS, "Chong'ai".
"The song just released in less than 12 hours, the girls were already familiar with it." said Xiao-xiong.

At 9 A.M. of 21st Mar., 23 hours after the release, outside the studio of CHEN Man's at Image Base (竞园) of Beijing, several fans gathered here with advanced cameras and lens, waiting for their idols.
TFBOYS, who had the costume preparation until mid-night yesterday, got on the car in staff's urge and have their make-up done here.

The styles in "Menghuan Xiyou 2" was the boys' first attempt on ancient costumes.
Swordsman WANG Jun-kai, Peripatetic childe WANG Yuan, and Dragon Prince YI Yang-qian-xi [The titles were translated by [TFEC-TFEngClub英文站](http://weibo.com/tfectfec)] amazed everyone.
Sky, the stylist of LI Bing-bing(李冰冰) and other hot celebrities, kept advising the staff to let them act in "ancient plays" during the make-up,
"the looks and temperament cannot be more suitable, it must be hot!"
The shoot later verified his judgement, just in photographing WANG Jun-kai, the famous photographer CHEN Man said "okay, very good" over ten times in five minutes.

In the afternoon, emcee LI Wei-jia(李维嘉) may not believe it, a Weibo post he wrote was reposted over 10,000 times in a very short time.
What he posted was the fans who came to the hotel one day earlier, to "convoy" the second "Journey to Happy Camp" of TFBOYS.

"The boys are now taller than emcees."
XIE Na(谢娜) remembered the scene this three "shy little boys" came to "Happy Camp" last May,
"they were shy when facing the audiences, they were quite thin that the clothes looked a little large."
When talking about the account of organising "little WANG Yuan"'s shirt, her tone was very like a "mum fan",
"their performances on stage improved hugely, I can clearly see their progress.
But they are still very cute, I'm happy to see their growth in different periods."

"TFBOYS' fans are very loyal and professional."
LUO Xin(罗昕), the producer of "Happy Camp", told us.
The boys' first show in "Happy Camp" is quite an accident, it should be credited to the young directors who saw their huge popularity on the web when searching hotspots,
"we didn't expect that the group of their fans be so enormous before that."

To some extent, "Happy Camp" was one of the places TFBOYS' "dream set sail".
Being well-known as the "powerful channel for gaining fans", "Happy Camp" has the national audience rating of 2% on average,
it means that once you entered the studio with only 1,200 seats, your face may be seen by 2% of the whole population with this top variety show of Hunan TV
-- that is 28 million people, equivalent to the population of some Europe country.
TFBOYS entered the eyes of traditional media via their first show here in 2014, their fans expanded from small circles of some video sites to all corners the variety shows of Hunan TV reaches.

Like the various groups in the squares at dusk[a joke about the conflicts among groups of "square dance"], there are factions inside the group of TFBOYS' fans, with the names derived from the mode of Korean fans
-- "Group fans" are those who like the three equally;
"shipping fans" are those who like the shipment between them, friends from childhood are the perfect match, "Kai-Yuan", "Qian-Kai", and "Qian-Yuan" are the three "shippings" ranked first to third;
"someone-only fans" are those who like only one of them, which called "Karry-only fans", "Roy-only fans", and "Jackson-only fans"...
Due to the thoughts and actions of fans themselves, it is otherwise divided into "mum fans", "privacy fans", "Loli fans", "virgin fans", etc.
"It's a complex organisation, an underground, but many fans are very concerned about the three boys."
Xiao-xi, who "dropped into the trap" over a year, told us.
Under the operation of "zero commercial performances + sell of peripheral commodities", the large amount of fans is the basic of TF economy, the delamination and differentiation inside fans maintains the vitality of the whole community and the operation of TF economy.

**TF Phased Exam**
## The Score of Youth

---

*P17*

In the studio at Image Base, TFBOYS like playing their mobiles or the toys on the desk between takes.
"Their status off stage are childish and cute."
A staff of NetEase told us, "When the boys came out with the costumes, everyone agreed that they are very suitable!
Maybe the characters created in 2004 should be what they look like."
She also revealed that the ancient play of the same name is under preparation, "we have strong intention of inviting the three national teens."

This three boys came out from grass-root, grew on the web, but haven't been flattered as a sign of heroism by worthless mentors of success [a sarcasm of so-called "Success ology"].
They are imperfect, have many aspects in singing and dancing to be improved, are usually shy, nervous, or amusing like other children in front of the camera.
However, it IS the explicit "incompleteness" that aroused the fans' participation and the desire of protecting them, which prompted the fans to take part in the "ten-year plan of cultivation" with lots of manpower and material resources.
Hence, TFBOYS became one of the first idols ACG fans in China successfully cultivated in this mass-decentralised transmission time.

If we take one year as a semester of the "ten-year promise", what will be the score of the first semester?

### Performance + Etiquette
**Rank: A**

*P19*

### Vocal music
**Rank: B+**

- Reviewers: LIU Jia(刘佳)(composer of "The Manual of Youth" and "Chong'ai") and WANG Yun-yun(王韵韵)(lyricist of "The Manual of Youth" and "Chong'ai")

WANG Yun-yun is the lyricist of "The Manual of Youth"(hereinafter referred to as "Manual") and "Chong'ai", who wrote the famous "left hand, right hand, a slow motion".
Unlike the creation of the rhythms without rework, the lyrics of "Manual" had been altered many times, she made great changes even when the deadline's near,
"the rhymes were totally changed, because the rhythms are attracting, I don't want the lyrics to drag behind."
Then, there came the words "follow me, left hand, right hand, a slow motion".

"When I accepted the case, I hadn't seen the boys," WANG Yun-yun recalled,
"I watched their singing videos on the web, and found their voice are pure, their expressions are proper, so I determined the theme of vitality, youth, growth, and positive before writing 'Manual'."
The addictive words "left hand, right hand, a slow motion" were written under the consideration of performance, designed in accordance with the dance moves,
"it's intentionally aimed at been addictive, the reaction is beyond my expectation."

"They improved a lot from 'Manual' to 'Chong'ai'."
WANG Yun-yun told us, "They were little boys when singing 'Manual', while 'Chong'ai' appended a little sentimental love, but they expressed very well.
Moreover, I found exclusive characteristics from their voices, the distinction is forming.
That's a good trend."

Post-1980s composer LIU Jia cooperate with WANG Yun-yun on the two songs, he was present at each time the boys enter the studio, to control and guide the recording.
"They were changing voices, their conditions were different,"
LIU Jia said, "so one of them mainly took the refrain, one the beginning, one the rap."
Because of the school study and activities, they were always tired when recording,
"while 'Manual' and 'Chong'ai' are lively or sweet songs, I have to motivate their mood."
He used many methods "like telling jokes, or encourage them badly."
He also found their improvement, "they always came here after other work, and were very tired, but they were very serious and hard-working in recording, that's quite difficult for children."

- Reviewers: XIE Na, LUO Xin(producer of "Happy Camp"), and YUAN Qi(袁琪)(director of "Day Day Up"(天天向上))

TFBOYS had been invited to the stage of "Day Day Up" with Danish Ambassador to China as delegates of Chinese youths.
YUAN Qi, a director of the programme, said, the agency gave the director group presents like hot pot condiments, the boys were modest and courteous,
"the most impressive one was YI Yang-qian-xi, he's conserved and less talkative, but he would listen to you carefully, remember everything you've said."
In the preparation, the director asked if he could present a calligraphy work to the ambassador, but the idea didn't carry out on stage due to interim adjustments.
"After the shoot, Qian-xi found me and asked cautiously whether he could give the present to the ambassador.
I was very touched."
YUAN Qi said, Qian-xi finally met the ambassador at the backstage, wrote down "Hui Chi Fang Qiu"(挥斥方遒, "Filled with student enthusiasm Boldly we cast all restraints aside."("Poetry of Mao Zedong", Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopaedia)), and gave it to him.
The ambassador liked the work very much, put it up at once in Danish Embassy in China.
"He's very attentive, versatile, and courteous."

The boys' change on stage was obvious to all.
LUO Xin told us, TFBOYS' stage performance improved a lot this time, "it can be seen that they practised personal skills hard.
This is a must for guests or, say, entertainers, because one should ensure that there's a highlight in the performance, to show the unique character of one's own."
LUO said, audiences would see TFBOYS' great improvement in singing and dancing in the programme to be shown,
"there are their dance solo, I can tell it's great from the raw material I got.
Besides, they have a cooperation with Phoenix Legend(凤凰传奇), they sing Phoenix Legend's song, and Phoenix Legend sing TFBOYS' 'left hand, right hand, a slow motion', this section was excellent!"

"TFBOYS have another advantage others cannot imitate, that is purity.
You can see the purity on them."
There's a typical section in "Happy Camp", while in this episode, the guests should bring one of the most important stuff for them to the stage, and if the magic show failed, that stuff may be destroyed.
"To those practised entertainers, such a game would be seen as attitudinising, but the three boys showed that they are very scared that the beloved one may be destroyed.
They believe that it will be destroyed if the show failed."

LUO said, YI Yang-qian-xi brought his favourite toy, a bear.
It's easy to tell that the bear is vitally important to him, because his lips turned white when the bear was taken away, and he's really nervous when the emcees' talking to him,
"He was very very scared that the bear may be destroyed."

"I think it's much related to the responsible managing team," YUAN Qi assessed,
"the staffs would take the videotapes back and analyse carefully, this may improve their performance, while at the same time, the purity in their heart remained still."
XIE Na, as a "mum fan", said directly,
"I think it's very difficult for the boys to transfer between work and study incessantly.
I hope that everything goes well to them, that they can always do what they like to, that they can be casual and happy all the time."

**About Addictive Songs, Addiction, and "Lady Boy Friends"(A Thai drama)**
#### Listen to Pavarotti and Watch "Eight Lady Boys", I'm Drunk
*["I'm drunk." is a meme on Chinese social networks, means one is speechless, or any similar feeling.]*

**Q:**
"Chong'ai" is sweet to the heart, is it about love on campus?  
**K:**
Well, yes. (Earnestly.)  
**Q:**
(Spoke evilly.) Then what were you thinking about during the recording?  
**K:**
(Still earnestly.) The key is to smile, because it's very sweet, we should feel the love with friends and parents, and sing with such smile.  
**R:**
t's simple to me.
They said hurry up, sing it with happiness, and you can have something to eat after it finished!
Then I was feeling happy, and opened my throat, and made it.
(**Q:** So it's a taste like ice-cream?)
I was thinking about snacks, so I was recording happily.  
**J:**
(Being cool.) Um... The teacher told us to sing with smile, the emotion would be better.  
**Q:**
I think "Chong'ai" is similar to "The Manual of Youth" in that the rhythms and lyrics are addictive.
"Manual" is very popular recently, even Yongzheng(雍正)'s cover appeared.  
**K:**
Yes, I watched it.
And WANG Yuan had a cosplay of the pose in a Weibo post.  
**R:**
(Saying with body movements.) Yes, but the poses of left hand and right hand are too difficult, I just posted with the last pose.  
**Q:**
And there's HUANG Xiao-ming(黄晓明)'s version.  
**J:**
I know, the muscle man version.  
**Q:**
Many schools set "Manual" as the theme song for class-break exercises, isn't it cool?  
**K:**
I don't know about that.  
**Q:**
Then, have you heard of "Manual" on the street?  
**J:**
I haven't. I rarely go out.  
**R:**
Once I went to Suning(Implant Ad No.1, please pay for it), and heard "Love Starts Off"(爱出发), that was fine, but then the sound turned to "big sale, great promotion of xxx", then I was ...

**(Attention, high energy ahead!)**

**Q:**
So your songs are all quite "mo xing"(魔性, means addictive, brainwashing).  
**R:**
Yep.  
**Q:**
Do you really know what "mo xing" means?  
**J:**
I didn't know indeed.  
**Q:**
In fact, the series of "Absolutely Unexpected"(万万没想到) Qian-xi used to act in can be called "mo xing".
By the way, have you seen something that make you feel absolutely unexpected, but cannot stop reminding of it? That's "mo xing".
Dramas, anime, or songs will be okay.  
**K:**
A Thai drama, "Lady Boy Friends".  
**Q:**
I'm watching it! That "Eight Lady Boys"!  
**K:**
Actually I didn't watch it, I heard of it from them, and saw some snapshots on Weibo, it's disgusting and comical, then I left it aside...
Actually I didn't watch something "mo xing" recently.  
**R:**
I'm listening to operas these days, it's brainwashing.
(**Q:** Which operas?)
Those sang by Pavarotti and others I don't know.
One segment lasts over twenty minutes, I kept listening, but didn't know what they are singing about, just kept listening, they kept singing, I kept replaying.
(**Q:** Have you tried to sing?)
No, that's... quite advanced.
(**Q:** You can insert bel canto to your song.)
It may not be done.
I may take arts exam probably, there would be bel canto, so listen to it will be helpful.
(**Q:** To cultivate the sense of "mo xing", right?)
Right.  
**J:**
I didn't see other dramas but "Lady Boy Friends", I changed my profile picture to it.  
**R:**
I collected everyone's profile in my Friend Circle, I can now summon the dragon.
[A meme on Chinese social networks: "After collecting nine photos, one can summon the dragon." It has no extended meanings.]
(**Q:** The photos of "Eight Lady Boys"?)
Yes, that's it.

**About Ancient Costumes, Chivalrous Men, and Time Travel**
#### "Travel back to the war against aggression, to kill invaders with bare hands"

**(Okay, let's talk about something normal...)**

**Q:**
You are so handsome in ancient costumes, is it your first attempt?  
**K:**
Yes.  
**Q:**
Is there any character you like in ancient costumes?
Games, fictions, dramas will be okay.  
**K:**
I like QIAO Feng(乔峰) in "Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils"(天龙八部, a novel written by JIN Yong(金庸)).
(**Q:** The chivalrous style?)
Yes, he's free and easy, and very charming.
(**Q:** But he has a big beard.)
Yes.  
**R:**
I haven't seen any ancient play.
Um, I like rangers skilled in archery or long-distance attack, or magicians.
I like fantasy fictions better.  
**J:**
The most impressed is "Journey to the West", I like Sun Wukong(孙悟空, Monkey King).  
**Q:**
Qian-qian(YI Yang-qian-xi) likes Sun Wukong, is anyone fond of something wired? In "Journey to the West".  
**R:**
I like that "do you dare to answer if I called you".
[The scene mentioned here was probably a special drama edition of "Journey to the West".]  
**J:**
(Smiled.) Yes, Golden and Silver Horned Kings.
Actually I like the version Dicky Cheung(张卫健) acted in better than the 1986 one.
(**Q:** That's quite an old version, I watched it many years ago.)
It is on air in my age.  
**Q:**
Your age... The aunties will be sad...
Well, what's your impression when you take on such costumes for the first time?
Please make some comments on each other's costumes.  
**K:**
The front of Jackson's (costume) is stiff, but the cloth around is soft, I found his weakness when playing with him.  
**R:**
I think I have weaknesses all round, because it (my clothes) is soft from top to bottom, both of them have armour.
(**Q:** You are vulnerable.)
Yes, I should be the secondary attack, the assist.  
**J:**
The folding fan WANG Yuan held is funny, my Dragon Prince style is interesting, but the horns overhead are strange.

**(Attention, bold words ahead, we are not responsible for any possible sadness.)**

**Q:**
You have horns overhead?
That's like "Xiao Long Ren"(小龙人, literally: "Little Dragon Man").
Have you watched "Xiao Long Ren"?  
**K:**
No.  
**R:**
What's that?  
**J:**
I know it.  
**Q:**
(T_T) Well, we have common topics, Qian-xi, they are too young!  
**J:**
My mother led me to watch.  
**R:**
Oh, I remembered, it's that "I have horns over head..."
(Singing the song.)  
**Q:**
You also know it. That's correct!  
**R:**
That's a big horn bull, hahahaha.
(Actually, our journalist didn't get it, until now.)  
**Q:**
(Grasping chest.) I can't catch up with you now...
The next question, if time travel were possible, what time do you want to travel back?  
**J:**
The war against aggression.  
**Q:**
Have you thought of travelling back then, becoming a guerrilla leader?
Like the one who fly onto a train from a bicycle...
[A joke about an exaggerated scene in a drama themed at resisting aggression in World War II.]  
**J:**
Hahahaha, kill invaders with bare hands would be better.
(**Q:** Have you ever thought of travelling to those dramas?)
Nope.  
**K:**
I would rather stay at present, it's peaceful.
(**Q:** Don't you want to be a chivalrous man like QIAO Feng?)
But chivalrous men are easy to die.
(**Q:** You would be willing to only when you have fruit of life for regaining H.P.?)
Um, to go back to the ancient time, I should have kungfu, use Ch'ing kung to walk around, or it's too tired to walk on feet.  
**R:**
I would like to travel back to Tang Dynasty.
(**Q:** Why? To eat much and be fat?)
No, because I must be the smartest there, they would worship me as a deity.
Just imagine, Tang Dynasty is the most prosperous time in ancient China, firms would give me a lot of money, and a lot of food, which won't have in other dynasties.

*P24-25*

**About Idol, Love, and Grown-up**
#### "Being grown-up is the ability to live alone."

**(Too cute expressions ahead, please be aware.)**

**Q:**
Karry and Roy like Jay Chou(周杰伦), so you may be very familiar with Vincent Fang's lyrics.
[Vincent wrote many of Jay's songs.]
And now you cooperate with Vincent.
If there's a test about his lyrics, how many marks can you get?  
**K:**
Maybe sixty, seventy, or eighty? My memory's not very good.  
**J:**
I'm not sure, I listen to Korean music and dance music more.  
**R:**
Maybe thirty to forty, I know the classic ones, but he wrote too many songs.  
**Q:**
Which words in his lyrics do you like the best?  
**K:**
"Chaotic Monster, The old pal in my dream is called Chaotic Monster."
[Translated based on the work of [TFBOYS资讯海外翻译](http://weibo.com/TFGlobal).]
(Our journalist didn't know which song is it.)  
**Q:**
As to being idols, YANG Mi(杨幂) had told you to "study hard, be in love a bit later".
Have you set a threshold of when to "be in love"?  
**K:**
Twenty... or twenty-five.
(**Q:** Won't it be too late?)
It's suitable.  
**R:**
Maybe twenty-two to twenty-eight, I don't know.
It's too early to think about it.
Maybe when I'm stable in work, when I can give the beloved one a better life.
(**Q:** What a tender man, what's your zodiac sign?)
Scorpio...
(A staff aside whispered, "his ascent sign is Cancer~")  
**J:**
I have no idea. (Felt awkward.)
Maybe when I grown-up, after entering college or having a job.  
**Q:**
What is "being grown-up" like in your mind?  
**K:**
It's when I can make considerations in a mature way, not in personal loyalty.
(**Q:** You ARE good-tempered at present.)
Sometimes I'm impatient, unwilling to answer other people, I want to be calmer and more decent.
And, only becoming an adult can a person be grown-up.  
**R:**
It's the age of eighteen.
(**Q:** What if you are still acting like this at that time?)
That's the mind which doesn't grow up, the body's grown up.
(**Q:** The body's grown up, but the mind's still honesty, right?)
Right.  
**J:**
Being grown-up is the ability to live alone.
It's the time I can make my own decisions, and have my own spaces.

**About Film... YANG Mi and Park Shin-hye(박신혜, 朴信惠)**
#### "WANG Yuan's Goddess is Park Shin-hye"

**Q:**
Karry's going to play in a film directed by ZHANG Yi-mou(张艺谋), have you met him yet?  
**K:**
Yes, I'm a little nervous then, but it's fine, Mr. ZHANG was very amiable.
(**Q:** Had he encouraged you?)
Yes.  
**Q:**
What's your determination about the playing?  
**K:**
Be relaxed and unconstrained.  
**Q:**
Is there any film genre or director you like?  
**R:**
Horror films!
I like those I cannot rein, like "The Fast and the Furious", "The Expendables", the coolest ones.
(**Q:** Horror films? Have you watched "The Raging Horrible Events"(暴走恐怖事件)?)
No, I just know "Rage Events"(暴走大事件).
(Implant Ad No.2, please pay for it.)  
**J:**
I like action films, it's cool and impassioned.  
**Q:**
Is there any director, actor, or actress you would like to cooperate with?  
**R:**
... Park Shin-hye. (With a bashful smile.)  
**Q:**
Don't be shy, we know that.
What about Qian-xi?  
**J:**
I don't have one.
I would like to cooperate with any senior, if only the character's not exaggerated.  
**Q:**
And Karry?  
**K:**
I'm happy with any senior...
Um... YANG Mi.
(Okay, we'll convey it to her.)
And Jay.

**About Adolescence, "Xiao Xianrou", and Lucky Money**
#### "I'm not flirtatious, I'm sexy."

**Q:**
In the "xiao xianrou" ranking we polled recently, you ranked the fifth.
Do you know what "xiao xianrou" means?  
**K:**
I don't know, a new buzzword for the post-2000s?
I don't know.
(The overlapping sound inside our journalist: I am much older than you!)
I didn't get it before, and am still puzzled about it.  
**R:**
"Xiao xianrou"... refers to children who are pure, funny, and amusing.
(**Q:** That's exactly you...)
I refused to admit it at that time, but heard it everywhere later on, and, "duang", I'm used to it.
[A meme on Chinese social networks.]  
**J:**
It means those children...
(**R:** He is one.)
I'm not, it's a calling to the very cute and small children.  
**Q:**
Entering adolescence, you experienced voice-changing and being taller, Karry's almost finished voice-changing, in my view.  
**K:**
It's about to end.
Now in terminal stage.
(**R:** Terminal stage of voice-changing cancer.)
It's in the end in general, there will be some time to make it fully stabilised, my vocal music teacher said.  
**J:**
All of us are changing voices.
(**Q:** But Roy's voice is still relatively sharp.)  
**K:**
He's in the early stage of voice-changing cancer.  
**R:**
My voice has changed for a period, just not very obvious.  
**Q:**
As you are physically growing now, is there anything you should pay special attention to?
Like eating or physical exercises?  
**K:**
To grow taller, one should jump more.
I play basketball with my fellows sometimes.  
**R:**
All the people tell me to eat more.
(**Q:** But you are still very slim.)
So I eat a lot.  
**J:**
Um, exercise more and sleep more, that's enough.  
**Q:**
Have you received lucky money for the New Year?  
**K:**
Yes, but...
(**Q:** Did you have to give out money to your younger siblings?)
No, I don't have younger siblings, I don't have sisters, (the children in) my family are all boys.  
**Q:**
Who keeps the money, you or your parents?  
**K:**
My parents keep some, I take some.  
**J:**
My parents gave me some, and my relatives gave theirs to my parents.  
**Q:**
Have your parents said, "We save the money for you, we'll give it to you when you grow up."  
**K:**
Yes.
(**Q:** Do you find it a fraud?)
I knew it long ago, but I've no idea to get it back.  
**R:**
I refused to admit it at that time...
(**Q:** You've said it.)  
**Q:**
Do you have any New Year wish?  
**R:**
To grow taller, and progress in all aspects.  
**K:**
I also wish to progress in all aspects, be better in dancing, singing, and performance, and play in films or dramas.
(**Q:** Someone had said that Karry's more flirtatious on stage, she really used "flirtatious"!)
It's not flirtatious, it's sexy! (Earnestly.)  
**Q:**
(After a long laugh.) What about Qian-xi?  
**J:**
Grow bigger.
(**Q:** To be a muscle man?)
Yes, tall and muscular, like Eddie Peng(彭于晏).
(**Q:** That needs hard training. Do you have a muscle-building plan?)
I'll grow taller first, people say that muscle man won't grow taller.

**About Fans, Web Hotspots, and "Duang"**
#### "I refused to admit it"

**Q:**
Do you keep following those funny things on the web?  
**R:**
Yes, that taking selfies on the motorbike was very funny.
(**Q:** You want to try it?)
Not very much, actually, when I heard of it, I refused to admit it...
(**Q:** You said it many times.)  
**Q:**
Do you know PANG Mai-lang(庞麦郎)'s new song "Modi Da Biao Ke"(摩的大飙客)?  
**K:**
That's already an old song.
(The three started singing the song.)  
**Q:**
Qian-xi, do you follow the web hotspots?  
**R:**
Follow wireless hotspots, Qian-xi follows wireless hotspots.  
**J:**
Wi-Fi is a necessity in life!  
**R:**
I'm the one who provide the hotspot, because I have the largest mobile data.  
**Q:**
I saw Karry's Weibo post about being harassed by fans, what do you want the fans not to do the most?  
**K:**
Many fans put off their classes or work to see us at our schools.
It wastes their time, while disturbs the normal working of our schools.  
**R:**
I don't like to see the fans in my school.
Because my school is open, anyone can walk into it.  
**J:**
I don't like the fans bothering my teacher and friends all the time.  
**Q:**
Please conclude yourself in the last year with three words.  
**K:**
Grown, taller, and domineering.  
**R:**
My words are normal -- tepid, progressing, and fighting.
(**Q:** You said "tepid", that's not your style.)
Why, I don't think I'm outstanding in something, or much lagged behind, I'm just working hard, that's "tepid".
(**Q:** Still not your style.)
Duang~
(**Q:** Yes, that's it.)  
**J:**
Just getting taller, that's all.
