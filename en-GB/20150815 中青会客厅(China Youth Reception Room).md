**M:**
Hello, friends.
Welcome to "China Youth Reception Room", I'm the MC Ting-ting.
Today, we are very glad to invite this popular idol group -- TFBOYS. Welcome.  
**A:**
Hello, we are TFBOYS.  
**M:**
Nice to meet you.
Please show your greeting.  
**K:**
Hello, I'm WANG Jun-kai. I'm 16, now study in Chongqing.  
**R:**
Hello, I'm WANG Yuan. Yes, WANG Yuan.  
**J:**
Hello, everyone, I'm YI Yang-qian-xi. I'm 15.

**M:**
You are so young.
I know that you've just attended "Sunny Posting" started by CYLC and New Media Association of China Youth.
Do you surf the web frequently?  
**K:**
We don't have much time on the web, because we should take training or have lessons.  
**M:**
Your schedule is full.
What do you do when you are on the web?  
**K:**
Talking with fellows, watch the fans' comments on Weibo.
All plain things.  
**M:**
What do you two do?  
**R:**
I play games, watch Weibo posts, or chat on WeChat.
It's quite normal, nothing special.  
**M:**
And Qian-xi?  
**J:**
Just watch Weibo posts, and talking with my fellows.

**M:**
You have a huge number of followers on Weibo.
I wonder that except posting your Weibo posts, do you interact with others?
Such as talking with other stars or your fans.  
**K:**
We seldom post on other sites except Weibo.
As to interactions, we usually watch, but not interact with others, because there are too many posts.  
**M:**
It's hard to replay them all.  
**K:**
Yes.

**M:**
It is easy to be impacted by violence like verbal attack on Weibo.
As you are so popular, such things may be quite familiar.
So, what's your feeling when encounter such attacks?  
**R:**
I think that everyone has advantages and disadvantages, it's impossible to make everyone like you.
And different people have different views on the same thing.
What we should do is to see the pros, and pay attention to the cons.
That's enough.  
**M:**
You take it quite normally.  
**R:**
I was very uncomfortable at first, but become much better now.

**M:**
In such attacks, who is the most impatient?  
**K:**
We are much the same.
I won't talk to them about such things, just keep it in the heart.
We are quite familiar with these, we are used to them.
There's no need to worry.

**M:**
When you first encounter such things, did you feel down or depressed?
Or be suspicious of yourself?  
**R:**
At first, when seeing the contempt, we are upset, sometimes much depressed, might talk to each other.
But we were used to them later.
Those words also motivate us.
I am now sedate.

**M:**
Who often comfort others at such time?  
**K:**
Comfort others?  
**M:**
Do you? As you are elder.  
**K:**
Well, I am elder.
As to comforting, I would tell them not to see those things.
As to me, the negative words give me motivation of doing my best.

**M:**
As the ambassadors of "Sunny Posting", what do you think is the meaning?
How is your feeling?  
**K:**
I think its meaning is the positive energy it sends out.
In this cyberspace filled with violence, we should call for civilised and rational behaviours.  
**R:**
We will use our influence to call for civilised actions, to make the web a nice place like a garden.  
**M:**
Like a garden, a good description.
And Qian-xi?  
**J:**
Trust is the premise of communication.
Without trust, the quarrels make things meaningless.
I hope people could be understand and respect each other.

**M:**
If the fans have unfriendly or hostile actions, do you persuade them not to, or do something else?  
**R:**
We are a group, the fans behaves out of the favourite to us.
I hope them like the entirety, the whole TFBOYS.
And for the displeasure, communication solves problems, just like we do.  
**K:**
People may have different opinions on one thing, then there needs communication.
Judge others' feelings by one's own.  
**M:**
Judge others' feelings, that's very good practice.
And Qian-xi?  
**J:**
People may have variant favourites, while I hope they like the whole TFBOYS.

**M:**
Being the ambassadors, what will you do next?
Such as, make more fans join the events of "Sunny Posting".
What's your plan?  
**R:**
The Internet is a huge platform, no one can make it a peaceful place at once.
We will start with ourselves, and then influence others with our action.
Be patient, not too anxious.  
**M:**
Jun-kai, what do you think?  
**K:**
Just like WANG Yuan said, start with ourselves, and make others adapted to the civilised habit.  
**J:**
We will use our influence, lead others with positive energy.

**M:**
Just like the old saying goes that good words warm in cold winter, abusive ones frozen in hot summer.
You must have gotten encouragement from fans.
Is there something that impressed you the most, which encouraged or warmed you when your are lost, helpless, or tired?  
**J:**
The fans often comment under the posts that tell us to rest more and eat more.
When I get off a plane, these words on Weibo make me delighted.  
**M:**
All the comments are encouraging you, right?
And Jun-kai?  
**K:**
The fans comment with key points of the exam.  
**M:**
Key points of the exam, that's very useful.  
**K:**
Or tell us to rest in time, words like this.
It feels warm.  
**M:**
And WANG Yuan?  
**R:**
In the last year, no, the year before that, when we just debuted, there's much criticise.
But there's still many people supporting us in objective comments.
They pointed out our pros and cons, that we could make improvements.

**M:**
You have a huge number of fans, do they do something for public weal all by themselves?
I know that fans of other stars do such things.  
**K:**
Our fans often take activities for public weal, like donating or caring for elders.
And we would like to give them praise.  
**M:**
And you two?  
**R:**
We attended in some events for public weal, and the fans responded actively, brought huge influence on the activities, and donated many things.  
**J:**
We know what they did for public weal, and we gratified by their actions.
We will keep supporting them with our influence.

**M:**
Could you say something about your recent plans?
About work or life.  
**K:**
Study hard in school, and get training at weekends, to increase our strength.
Mostly like this.  
**M:**
That's simple.  
**K:** Yes.

**M:**
Will you develop new skills at your short spare time?  
**K:**
In the short spare time, I think, Qian-xi will play with his younger brother.  
**J:**
Stay with my family.  
**M:**
You are sensible.
And WANG Yuan?  
**R:**
I'm going to take the Entrance Exam next year.
During the time before preparing for it, I will do my best on the events we attend, then on the exam.  
**M:**
And Qian-xi, anything else? Besides staying with your family, what would you like to do in your spare time?  
**J:**
I'm going to join a higher school this September, I wish to adapt to it fast, so school study is important.
In other time, that will be training and events.

**M:**
Okay. We are very glad to invite young, charming, and popular TFBOYS here.
That concludes today. Thank you for watching, see you next time.
