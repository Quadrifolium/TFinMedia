Youth is full of uncertainties, take it easy with the growing pains.
The boys who were imitating other singers in love songs, now have their distinctive self-cognition.
As idols of this new era of entertainment, they are in adolescence and voice-changing, but facing the most complex constitution of fans, public voice, and the taste of audiences than ever before.
This complex environment is pushing them fast forward.
To our surprise, only in several months, not just the heights, their entertainer consciousness and self-cognition are also growing.
As the youngest idol group of China, TFBOYS is controversial from their debut.
It's unfair that many doubts and unreasonable blame came just because they are young and popular.
However, it is pleased to see that the boys have their own judgements, they have strong and upright attitude which is beyond our imagination.
They don't fear or evade, but face them bravely.
The calm and easy manner is more tolerable than many adults, which is a part of their growth.
"Make no compromises on the way, a true man has nothing to lose".
Though young, they are already responsible young men.

# TFBOYS, In the Name of Youth

### Reading of the Manual

TFBOYS debuted in 2013 with the hit song "Mengxiang Qihang"(梦想起航, literally: "The Dream Sets Sail") of the first E.P. "Heart Meng·Chufa"(Heart梦·出发, literally: "Heart, Dream Starts Off").
Their single "Magic Castle"(魔法城堡) released in Mar. 2014 topped on Yin Yue V-Chart for three months.
In late autumn of 2014, TFBOYS came back with their first mini album named under the hit song "Manual of Youth"(青春修炼手册).
The first 20,000 physical albums were sold out in two minutes.
In the songs, the specific pure voice of 14- and 15-year-old boys shows distinctive infection, causes longing and resonance in teenagers' minds, and initiates many adults' memories about the joy and happiness in their youth.
"The fragrance stays in the hand that gives the rose."
This was a sentence in their textbook.
After becoming ambassadors of public weal events, delivering love and hope with their own practices, the persistence of the dream that showed in the song may have specific definition and interpretation in their heart.
The MV of "In the Name of Faith"(信仰之名) to be published in December tells an inspiring story about three boys' struggle in difficulties and conspiracy, which coincides with TFBOYS's growth.
TFBOYS makes a declaration of the youth with their innocence and courage under public's great attention.
In the eyes of adults, the words may be immature, while the road in the name of youth is more or less arduous.
But it is undeniable that, unlike the filthy adult world, the optimistic and positive attitude they have, the firm and enthusiastic faith they pursue, are more persuasive in the time that only belongs to them.
Hence, "Manual of Youth" the boys sang in their clear voices resonates in many people's hearts.
When the storm of TFBOYS continues this winter, when the boys are growing like a storm and breaks away from the names of "subject idols" and "phenomenal stars", when they are accepted by more people, when they are awarded "The Most Popular Group" and gets "Hit Song of the Year" repeatedly, the growing idols in the name of youth made a successful counter-attack.

**WANG Jun-kai**
### Cultivates Youth

Anyone in their childhood has no strong willpower, may easily quit doing something.
That's because one's mind is weak and immature, still lacks proper attitude and persistence.
When grown to be a teenager, the puberty, rebellion, and voice-changing become troublesome.
The subtleness lies that some prolong the rebellious period, while some are forged to be talents.
As the leader of the group and a senior middle school student, experienced honours and popularity in the year, surrounded by the pressure of public voices, WANG Jun-kai has grown fast in height and mentality.
From being pushed forward to actively stepping forward, the changed attitude makes the calm and easy manner firmer.
In WANG Yuan's words, he "seems like a quiet man, but is actually restless in the heart."
But as the leader, he has to cast off the agitated appearance, and take charge of the position.
Being gazed by serious eyes, he does more and talks less.
To rumours, he is aware and confident, "you can't make everyone like you, each one has his/her own criteria.
I won't evade or please them, I will just be myself."
To the gains and losses as an entertainer, his opinion is objective, "student is an obligated character, while entertainer a hobby."
To the doubts the popularity brings about, he takes ordinarily, "we are lucky to come closer to our dream earlier than others."
Such growth in mind is a surprise which is hard to describe in words.
This summer, his wish is plainly "to have over 5 million fans", which has greatly exceeded at present.
Now his wish is "to have a concert on a large stage", to make more people see their performance.
Bearing pressures beyond imagination, but sticking firmly and aspiring clear goal, WANG Jun-kai is cultivating his youth, the future is shining ahead.

**WANG Yuan**
### Lucky Symbol

Buoyant and vigorous, brings joy to wherever he is.
To him, sunshine emits fragrance.
As for being an entertainer, WANG Yuan has his unique consciousness.
He is always confident at showing himself, once he starts to express, nothing can hold him back.
He also has precise outsight and objective viewpoints, does well in "thinking in shifted position" that adults can't handle well.
He knows his shortages clearly, has been upset at his dance, but he can always regain self-confidence soon.
To reasonable critics, he accepts open-mindedly;
to vicious accuses, he takes them easy, "those who maligns you are no good than you".
This attitude is great to a 15-year-old boy.
At the same time, his soberness is more valuable.
The soaring popularity brings fame, worship, and boundless ardour.
But on the contrary, he understands that "there's no favour without reason", he cherishes and appreciates all those who likes them or assists them.
All these behaviours are far beyond his age, are maturer than some adults.
Furthermore, this little boy are earnestly concerned about the group.
In our early interview, WANG Yuan showed firm longing and confidence for the cohesion and unity of the group.
Now TFBOYS owns great favour, his top wish is still simply "being healthy and progressing together".
This boy, who's concentrated in work and naughty in play, is full of positive energy, cures the tiredness in your heart, and gives infinite hope to those who like him.
He is like an angel, a lucky symbol, one can get from him that "youth will never run away".

**YI Yang-qian-xi**
### In the Name of Faith

During the shoot of "In the Name of Faith", facing the story full of trials and frustration, Qian-xi made his interpretation, "youth is to become strong, despite of being injured."
This is maturer than his age.
Taking training persistently and challenging himself restlessly from very young, Qian-xi is mature from inside out, which makes him "cold".
It's neither indifferent nor slow-motivated, he is always observing, thinking, and judging beforehand, then responds afterwards.
This makes him mature, highlights his character as an idol, reveals his action with natural panache.
When peers are enjoying their easy life, the everyday life of Qian-xi is filled with school study, training, public activities, and flight time.
He has little time to sit back, even the frequent and toilsome flying experiences are seen as relaxation.
"I like the life of being both a student and an entertainer.
I go to school at weekdays, and attend recordings in Chongqing at weekends -- it's like having fun."
Qian-xi is strong and independent in mind, after been stricken by popularity and awards in 2014, his adaptability is strengthened.
All these make him maturer and more reliable.
Not everyone can be generous in that "maligners are of nothing, only if they feel happy."
Such a boy has played a cool role in their short play, and his changed voice turns lower and deeper.
Still, he is a boy, the youngest in the group.
Under the concern from WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan, he is revealing the innocence and playfulness of his age.
Now entered the 14th year of life, YI Yang-qian-xi is obsessive about the "ten-year performance".
This faith will lead him and the two friends to larger stages.
