Ko Chen-tung(柯震东) was arrested for taking drugs, some fans cheered him with "fighting" on the web because of his look;
Feynman, Francis Ng Chun Yu(吴镇宇)'s son, acted impressively in a TV show, some fans hacked out the information of his school, which almost made him to leave...
Nowadays, idols are getting younger, the fans' actions are getting crazier, adverse impact of an idol due to the overdosed fans is quite common.

Referring to idol fans, many people would call "crazy" or "overdosed" to mind at first.
However, the fans of the teen idol group TFBOYS from Chongqing impressed us, who had seen all kinds of crazy fans, with a new look, at the event held yesterday.
There were little chaos among thousands of waiting people, ticket scalpers from other places itching to profit seldom managed it.
It seems that the fans of the positive and optimistic TFBOYS should not be overlooked, their appearance is a plus to their idols.

**Thousands Waiting**  
**"Zhanzi" Ran For Order**
*[站子, organisations set under fans own accords]*

Idol group TFBOYS held a meeting at "Guo Tai Art Center"(国泰艺术中心) as the ambassadors of a brand yesterday afternoon.
Unlike a chaos imagined, thousands of fans gathered in the plaza, but the scattered crowd was not disordered
-- some standing and whispering, some sitting and playing mobiles...
Their faces were filled with expectations, the place was not noisy, just as normal as a common afternoon of this old town.

"'Zhanzi' should be credited with the ordered organisation."
Twins in fan T-shirts told us.
"Zhanzi" are formed by key members among fans, they are principals or main members of fan sites, and they are acquainted on the sites and get together to serve for the meetings or concerts of their idols.
"Many fans are good students, they are not overdosed."
Seeing our doubt, the twins talked about themselves, "we are students of CTBU(重庆工商大学, Chongqing Technology And Business University), had never been fans of any idol before,
our parents also like TFBOYS very much, they think it's not easy to be both versatile and well-educated."

**Scalpers Gathered In**  
**Scattered With No Profit**

Actually, the fans at the plaza clearly knew that it's hard to see TFBOYS even if came early, because the entrance tickets were too hot to get one.
"The tickets were not offered in public, but drawn by lot," a girl in glasses told us in a pity.
She's a sophomore of BFU(北京林业大学, Beijing Forestry University) in her summer vacation, requested by a fellow to record the meeting.
She couldn't enter the stadium, but only take some photos of roll-ups and posts.

We found there were two types of scalpers at the plaza -- besides natives, there were much more outsiders spoke in mandarin,
"it's so hard to get one sincerely, want it? 2,800 yuan."

Many fans came to inquire, few made the deal.
They were rational in believing that "we don't have to see them in real, it's good to support them outside, don't be enslaved to scalpers."
At last, the itching scalpers seldom made profit.

**Meeting Lasted Short**  
**One Song in Less Than One Hour**

At about 3:30 p.m., TFBOYS came on stage in fresh preppy style, with white shirts and black ties.
They kept smiling throughout the event, seemed adept in the interaction;
sometimes waved hands towards the audiences, with spontaneous cheers burst out.

We mentioned that the procedure had been curtailed [in security's demand, actually] to less than an hour.
After a game with fans, and a performance of Chinese calligraphy by YI Yang-qian-xi, the event ended up in their new single "Manual of Youth"(青春修炼手册).

### Teen Idols Show Positive Energy
### Fans Need Proper Guidance

This idol group growing in Chongqing had raised much attention and led to many discussions from the public.
Whether it's suitable for a teenager to become an idol, we interviewed an experienced critics of entertainment.
According to his opinion, their appearance exactly filled in the demands of the post-millennial group for idols, it is positive.
"Every age group needs an idol for the representation, TFBOYS is such an instance.
They are good in looks, in school study, and are talented.
These teenagers cultivated strictly in training mode are different from hyped adult idols, they are pure and natural, and this is an emerging positive things."

"I can tell that TFBOYS are also different from other entertainers, they are outstanding for being both good in school studies and versatile." said Ms. WANG, a media practitioner who is also a mother.
In her years of experiences in show biz, TFBOYS can be a positive model for her own child.
"I think it's fine to be a fan of an idol.
In fact, I was once a fan-girl, I did this in my teachers' and parents' permission.
But it needs to be properly guided, crazy behaviours and investing heavily in should be stopped."
