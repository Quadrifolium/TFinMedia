### Review of S.M.E.

They are the real youth, they are a limpid stream in show biz.
In 2014, they experienced "phenomenal" popularity, bore "phenomenal" slander and praise.
In the year, three boys aged under fifteen created many records -- 600,000 daily discussions on average, 1.5 million new followers (each person) per month -- surpassed A-list celebrities hugely.
WANG Jun-kai's post about his preparation of entrance exams received 600,000 reposts;
"Magic Castle" broke the MV viewing record kept by "Zui Xuan Minzu Feng"(最炫民族风, literally: "The Most Dazzling Folk Style") for many years in the first week
[Untrue. The record was broken in the last days on the chart];
the top variety show "Happy Camp"(快乐大本营) made their first show specially, while a scalped ticket priced 6,000 yuan at most...
A teen idol group made in China, hotter than Japanese and Korean stars was born, "TF phenomenon" became an enduring cultural trend, showed powerful strength and popularity in the performance in new media and big data.

Three boys' pure and young looks, fresh voices and dynamic dances, positive appearances and optimistic personalities arouse the power of energetic youth in people's hearts.
The good sale of the new album and the wide spread of "The Manual of Youth" and "The First Lesson at School"(开学第一课) was the recognition from the public, while variety shows like "Day Day Up"(天天向上) revealed the boys' warm heart and their sense on stage.
"Be good in school study + handsome and charming + have versatile skills" also accords with the mainstream value for "good teenagers", avoids being fallen into the bias for "child stars" or "teen idol groups".
They are good-looking, skilled, and hard-working, their road is broadening, their future will be bright and rich-decorated.

**Possible Breakthroughs**

New songs in March:
Encouraging + sentimental and lyric.
Can they exceed the propagation effect of "follow me, left hand, right hand, a slow motion"?
Let's wait and see.

The self-made variety show "TF Teens GO!" Season 3 is now on the web, while the first episode broke many records of Tencent Video.

Film "Great Wall"(长城):
The first English film of ZHANG Yi-mo(张艺谋), "Great Wall", started preparation in late January of 2015.
The film was said to be invested over 800 million yuan, was the first commercial film of ZHANG in his contract with Le Vision Pictures(乐视影业).
TFBOYS WANG Jun-kai was said to attend in, act with stars like Andy Lau(刘德华), ZHANG Han-yu(张涵予), LIN Geng-xin(林更新), LU Han(鹿晗), CHEN Xue-dong(陈学冬), Matt Damon, and Willem Dafoe.

### Reviews from Jury

LIANG Xiao-wen(梁晓雯) from "New Express"(新快报):
Age is everything.
They are still young after ten years, they can exceed LI Yi-feng(李易峰) and HUANG Xiao-ming(黄晓明).

FAN Yi-na(范艺娜) from iQiyi:
The hope of male groups are in the youth. Referring to the development path of groups of Johnny & Associates of Japan, they have infinite potential.

FENG Nan(冯楠) from "Yan Zhao Evening News"(燕赵晚报):
They are the youngest group, have good reputation and no negative issues.
Their fans are crazy, but there are also some people who can't distinguish them apart.
They are limited in the scope of works, but they are young, there's no need to hurry up. I believe that they have boundless prospects.

### Reviews from Show Biz

MENG Jing(孟静) (entertainment observer):
TFBOYS are out of top 3, I'm surprised, they should be higher in the rank.

AN Xiao-fen(安晓芬) (producer of "Tiny Times"(小时代)):
I noticed TFBOYS before, in an accident. I found they are very popular, but I didn't know them.
I was curious, and searched on the web. They are cute, and I became a fan.
