Though debuted less than two years, teen group TFBOYS is the real celeb on Weibo
-- the forward of their weibo averages 200,000 times, while the most forwarded one reached nearly 20 million, which exceeded the total forward of "People's Daily", "Southern Weekly", "Global Times", "CCTV News", and "Hunan TV" in one month.

More and more people found that they cannot avoid seeing a name which didn't exist two years ago -- TFBOYS.
TFBOYS' news often appear in Friend Circle or been forwarded on Weibo.
Even GUO Jing-ming(郭敬明), who's well-known of doing Weibo marketing, had his forwarding peak related to TFBOYS:
TFBOYS WANG Yuan's attending in his new film reached 1.2 million forwards, far above the attending of FAN Bing-bing(范冰冰), Kris Wu(吴亦凡), CHEN Xue-dong(陈学冬), or YANG Mi(杨幂).

Their fame exceeded many other public topics on Weibo, made some seniors in show biz sighed when facing the situation.

Many TFBOYS' fans commented: Mr. CHEN, we also like you very much, if they know you were there, they must send greetings to you.

TFBOYS did well on Weibo according to the data
-- From the second half of 2014, the average forward of each member's weibo is about 200,000, while the peak reached tens of millions.
The propagation effect is nearly the sum of the whole mainstream media.

However, their outstanding performance is only impressed on Weibo.
On the more traditional Baidu Tieba and famous anime video site AcFun.com and Bilibili.com, TFBOYS' performance is excellent but not superior to others.
They may receive music awards based on public votes, and get tens or even hundreds of millions of hits on their songs, but were not much well-known compared to Phoenix Legend(凤凰传奇), Eason Chan(陈奕迅), or Jay Chou(周杰伦).

"The Ordinary Road"(平凡之路) of PU Shu(朴树) may be a comparison.
To coordinate with the film, HAN Han(韩寒)'s weibo about the song reached over 380,000 forwards, matched with TFBOYS.
But this song was mentioned more often in media, from music and entertainment ones to integrated newspapers, local newspapers, and portal websites.
The dense reports made it an iconic event in media.

TFBOYS' songs were less mentioned by media, seldom broke the circle of entertainment.

The release of "The Ordinary Road" on HAN Han's weibo, was forwarded 380,000 times, commented 120,000 times.
It's a little higher than TFBOYS' on average, but had more influence on media.

WANG Jun-kai's weibo of the song "Man Cheng Hua Kai"(满城花开, literally: "Flowers Blossom Around City") was forwarded 300,000 times.

Except being surprised by TFBOYS, many people doubts:  
-- Why are the fans of TFBOYS in favour of Weibo?  
-- How do teen idol groups become popular in China?  
-- Why are the young fans so crazy?

Actually, the answer is easy.
TFBOYS, LU Han(鹿晗), EXO and other new stars or groups are different from the traditional mode of "Searching - Training - Releasing Work - Creating Topics - Media Following-up", they interact with fans vertically via Internet.

Their fans has a sort of democratic mania -- this is the idol they choose, their sense of identity is surely higher.

## Tradition of Mania

In history, fans' crazy action were very common.

The fans of MEI Lan-fang(梅兰芳) were astonishing.
Picking up at stations, holding an umbrella aside, or escorting the trips are the basics, they may line up for a ticket from night like what Apple's fans do today.

They may organise "MEI She"(club of MEI Lan-fang), facilitate MEI's tour to America, promote on a lot of American newspapers.
In China, besides organising each performance, they published a book named "MEI Lan-fang".

MEI's fans were mainly successful people in today's criteria, their support was surely comprehensive and powerful
-- they could provide the entire support for MEI.

Such support means deep participation.
It derived from Chinese traditional Kunqu Opera, composers cooperate with actors, literary men and composers guide the actors in lyrics and rhythms.
They support in money, are in close relation, strongly identify with it.

Later, there came films.
It's usual to see the famous actress Hu-die(蝴蝶, literally: "Butterfly") or RUAN Ling-yu(阮玲玉) chased by fans.
After RUAN's suicide, several fans followed up.
Just in 8th Mar. 1935, there were five girls died for this.

After mid-20th century, the rise of mass media brought huge number of stars, and the group of fans enlarged.
Such stars were well-known to many, but the audience didn't participate in their life and work.
It's hard for them to be crazier than opera stars before.

Teen groups are not new-born.
TFBOYS went to fame at under fifteen, but it doesn't mean the time of "zheng tai"(正太, means cute pre-adolescent boys, derived from Japanese word "shota", but differs from its English meanings) just started
-- Many world-class stars we know debuted young, some were younger than TFBOYS.

Famous groups/bands debuted before adulthood in Europe and America

"Xiao Hu Dui"(小虎队, Little Tiger), the well-known group which shocked the Chinese world, debuted at the age of eighteen, seventeen, and fifteen.

It may because of the early development of entertainment, senior entertainers in Taiwan were calm at the challenge from youths.
In 1992, thirty-year-old HUANG An(黄安) was impressed by eighteen-year-old Jimmy Lin(林志颖)'s looks from a post for the first time.
He was shocked that fans often take posts away before his album's on sale, and wrote the song "Qingchun Shaonian Yangyang Hong"(青春少年样样红).

There are many successful cases of teen groups, crazy fans are quite common.
Then, what made TFBOYS, a group seemed not well-decorated, aroused the fans' enormous passion?
What are the specialties TFBOYS differs from the teen groups before, which caused such a huge spreading capacity?

## Propagation Method and Sense of Participation

The biggest difference is the propagation method.

Among TFBOYS and fans, or some fans and other fans, the Internet is almost everything.
Compared to MEI Lan-fang and "MEI She" linked via performances, or the one-way transmission of Terasa Teng(邓丽君) and Andy Lau(刘德华) via radio and TV, the fans of TFBOYS have the most active interaction inside.

The change of propagation method brought new generating approach of idols -- talent shows.
Fans participate in the selection of idols using their votes, which makes them faithful.

TFBOYS went further with "the system of trainees".
Unlike Johnny & Associates of Japan and S.M. Entertainment of Korea, the members were chosen through the propagation on the web, fans' support is the core of the selection criteria.
Moreover, the fans participated in the growth of idols from the very beginning, they would be stickier.

The convenient Internet turns the stickiness into infinite possibilities, they even don't need media as a third party, but can keep track with every move of the idol,
while at the same time, develop trans-regional highly-specialised self-organisations easily.

Take Chinese fans' vote for Watanabe Mayu in AKB48 General Election as an example, it can be seen how did the fans mount their action under the certain voting system:

The core of fans set up a special team
→ Set up a shop on Taobao
→ Post announcement on Baidu Tieba, collecting money through the shop
→ contact with Japanese fans for the vote with remittance
→ Send verification code back to China
→ Finish the vote

This crazy participation resulted in many professional public events for idols:

2. Install LED with characters "WANG Yuan" on the sky wheel of Chongqing Amusement Park for three days;
3. Advertise on Youtube Asian-Pacific region.
(Ad before Youtube videos prices at 10 to 15 U.S. dollars per thousand shows, and banner ad 8 to 10 dollars, one ad may cost nearly 300,000 dollars per day.)

## New Rules for Post-2000s

However, there's a limitation
-- the fans are too young that they don't have too many related resources, the fan groups sufficient in finance are seldom,
which affects the way they declare their faith and presence.

According to a survey, most of TFBOYS' fans are young females, aged under twenty-five.

**Age of TFBOYS' fans:**  
On Sina Weibo  
**Under 18:** 42.46%  
**18-24:** 52.55%  
**25-29:** 3.7%  
**30-34:** 0.6%  
**35-44:** 0.54%  
**Above 45:** 0.15%  
On the entire web  
**0-19:** 35%  
**20-29:** 42%  
**30-39:** 14%  
**40-49:** 7%  
**Above 50:** 2%

**Male:** 10.88%  
**Female:** 89.12%  
On the entire web  
**Male:** 9%  
**Female:** 91%

(The survey result by Sina Entertainment.)

More 1990s and 2000s means more Internet natives.
According to the survey of Internet usage of 1990s by Baidu, 1990s used the Internet for 7.53 years on average, spends 11.45 hours on it each day, of which 60.52% of the access are from mobiles.

TFBOYS' fans are zealous about Sina Weibo, which is directly related to their young age and limit of resources
-- Their mania won't be like those in "MEI She", to give a mansion as a gift, or to solve problems with political power.
Internet is the powerful weapon for young-aged natives, and the popular Sina Weibo becomes the best platform for expressing their enormous energy.

TFBOYS' fans are active on Weibo, the communications among individuals are few, fan sites gather huge numbers of fans, and large fan sites cooperate closely.
The agency seldom engaged in at first, after realised their capacity, it kept communicating and cooperating with these organisations.

At the same time, teenage fans use Weibo more frequently than elder ones.
Their relationships there are simple, mostly schoolfellows or other fans, which is unlike adult users who have complex relationships and are more careful about the self-image.
Therefore, these fans are less worried about their forwards -- feel free at being talkative or being misunderstood.

It's easy to find out the effectiveness among famous fans and fan sites, and the propagation result is outstanding.

Regulations about forwards and likes for TFBOYS' fans

There exists cheating of purchasing for forwards or using special accounts for forwards only.
But all the marketing analysts been interviewed agreed that their real fans are much higher than other stars.

The fans may also do what they can -- buy clothes for them, send SMS messages to vote, buy drinks or candies of the brand they endorses.
These are the inexpensive and practicable options.

However, things are always changing.
Their fans started expanding territory, TFBOYS Tieba became more influencing. Male communities like Hupu.com and Tiexue.net have provocation posts about TFBOYS occasionally, evoked several large-scale Internet battles.
Such events increased internal cohesion of TFBOYS' fans, their propagation kept phenomenal increment.

More crucially, other influence started cooperation with TFBOYS.
Commercials have sharp eyes, since a soda brand and a candy brand signed contracts with them, the fans showed great enthusiasm in buying the products.
Other entertainment power like GUO Jing-ming's team, received a climax of the propagation of the new film.
All these expanded TFBOYS' social resources.

If one day, TFBOYS performed on the stage of CCTV Spring Festival Gala, they will certainly surpass spirited LIANG Bo(梁博) at the final of "The Voice of China".
At that time, Weibo may not be their main battlefield.
