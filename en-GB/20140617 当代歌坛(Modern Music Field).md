# TFBOYS
# COME TO SHOW YOU LOVE

MMF No.597 appeared in the "Hot Search Chart" of Weibo, this was a hot issue in the office recently.
A program of Sohu.com introduced TFBOYS using our clips...
There are more, and more.
All these made us really excited.
We've supplemented the prints, but there are some readers who still cannot have one, but ask for a high price on Taobao, at 128 yuan.
We didn't meant to, the new shooting plan is under preparation.
But anyhow, we should wait until boys finish their exams.
Actually, we are somewhat in doubt for another contact -- in the progress of their growth, after each concern, shoot, exposure, and promotion we made, how will it take effect?
No one knows.
Differing from other adult idol stars, their goal is too simple, their outfits are too crude, but their experiences are too real.
They have no high-end hardware to assist, they were just singing for the dream in plain coats, until now.
To tell the truth, they came here for the shoot by subway...
Too many people doubts why they can exceeds so many costly made qualified idols.
In fact, there are no complex reasons, and they didn't become popular suddenly.
They just made their efforts much earlier, and rushed out in their simple initial determination.
The boys in that ages reflect the happy memories in our heart, softly and firmly, they deserve to be treasured.

## Go to Work by Subway

Although they got up early, finished make-ups early, and started off early, the traffic in the capital was always a headache.
There was just half an hour left for the agreed shooting time, their car was still in the traffic jam.
The rehearsal of "Yinyue V-Chart Ceremony" is in the afternoon, there's no time to squeeze.
Then -- when we received a call, they were already in the subway with the staff.
Thirty minutes later, they came in with sweats on the noses and looked flurried.
That's really adorable.
And then came the apologies, "we are really really sorry, the traffic jam was really series."
But that's not your fault.
Actually, in my memories, other entertainers may come in their own luxury cars, in super vans, in minibuses, or even in Buick convoys, and being late for half an hour or an hour is not rare.
How about in subway?
"Don't be late" is much specific for children, and they did much better than many adults.
In other words, in many people's conceptions, taking public transportation loses reputation for an entertainer.
But for the boys, they are common students at first, the adults' fake reputation is not in their consideration.
However, after these two months, if they take the subway now, it may probably cause a jam itself.
This journey by subway would finally become an interesting memory.

On their way to the rest room, all kinds of instruments and props were placed aside, they were quite curious and wagging their heads all the way through.
Looking at their slim figures from behind, they were like three small white poplars.
In the last interview, we've said it's hard to teach Poplar No. 1 Jackson to make poses due to his late-adoption, even the dance moves he skilled in shall be posed for several tries.
But after receiving our encouraging, he smiled with dimples.
(Thumb-up for dimples.)
Poplar No. 2 Roy is smart enough to follow our direction or even pose without direction.
For example, in a close-up shoot, our photographer said, "what if I pinched you and run away?"
Then he followed with pretended angry eyes.
And the scene was taken, our photographer laughed out and praised for his comprehension.
As for Poplar No. 3 Karry -- every expression attracted, even our well-informed photographer made full of praise.
One thing I have to mention is, that we have all kinds of props and backdrops, every guest could find his/her interests and have great fun.
The Poplars were immediately attracted by the drum set used in our second scene, couldn't help glancing at it.
It seemed they wanted to have a try but didn't dare to.
Especially Jackson who's grabbing the drum sticks -- made a knock, stared at us, and made another knock -- as careful as a kitten.
Seeing their eyes, our photographer who had formed a band for many years, showed them with practised skills.
The three got the gesture, and posed with plenty of band style in the shoot.

## Reserved Boys Sharing Orange Juice

The soft white sofa in our studio has three seats, but there remained a position after the three boys sit in.
Xiao Dang[a nickname used to represent the interviewer] clearly felt that they were still little boys though already growing(saying with all sorts of emotions).
When they looked up at Xiao Dang(sitting on the chair) with bright eyes, Xiao Dang had a perception that a string in the head stirred suddenly, and the nose twitched, with something about to pour out.
(Yes, I'm piling unrelated words.)
Xiao Dang involuntarily slowed down the speed and softened the voice, almost in a tone like Ju Ping Jiejie[鞠萍姐姐, a famous TV emcee of children's programmes].
But we should remember that they are teenagers, that tone is unsuitable.
After handing out recorders to them, Xiao Dang met another problem: they didn't know how to use it and put it on strange places
-- Karry, why did you pile it into the cushions, how did you turn it off when take it out?
Xiao Dang was struggling with how to correct it, then Roy broke the embarrassment.
(Let's give him an applause.)
Roy held Jackson's neck in the arm when he hadn't realized and responded, held Jackson's hand with the recorder up in front of him, and said, "Is the distance suitable?"
Yes! Yes! Absolutely suitable!
You are so smart in the situation.

We prepared many kinds of beverages -- orange juice, cola, lemon tea, and energy drinks in a line.
Maybe they were too reserved to be here for the first time, when went to the rest room, Xiao Dang found that except the oolong tea the staff drank, the three just opened a bottle of orange juice, and the used cups were placed in order.
When asked didn't they feel thirsty during the two hours, Roy mentioned about the juice, the other two just shake their hands and heads.
Indeed, most children are reserved when visiting strangers.
But it made the interview as an interrogation in Xiao Dang's thought.
At last, I asked, "Am I horrible?"
The three were puzzled, then shaking their heads.
Their manager explained, "Answering questions feels like a test to them."
Xiao Dang noticed that when asking about recording and music, they acted in nervous and serious
-- these were professional questions after all, and they didn't want to be like rookies.
They had been criticized about voice-changing, singing skills, and dance moves, they cared about them much.
They were struggling for changing others' opinions, their sensitiveness was a typical teenagers' mind.
And this led to their gingerliness.

## On Teamwork

The three age between childhood and youth, their relationship is harmony and blended with different styles.
But as to astrology, the complementation in characters is so funny.
In our interview, Scorpio Roy was good at revealing the other two's unknown matters.
Sagittarius Jackson was late-adopted, nervous all the time, didn't know whether he'd be talked about.
When asked the first impression, he forestalled Roy not to mention the centre-parted hair.
But Xiao Dang heard it from you first, and it sounded funny...
Roy looked at him in sympathy, then said, "You see, he mentioned it himself, actually..."
During Roy's talking, Xiao Dang got a glimpse of Jackson in reluctant.
In fact, the acridity of Virgo and Scorpio are the same.
But Roy wasn't afraid of Karry's words, and would scoff back with body movements.
Karry had the common failing of Virgos -- act exaggerated at punch lines.
He would laugh first when others didn't get the point yet.
While Roy was good at acting funny, Karry's always smiling or laughing, seemed undignified at all.
Xiao Dang could often see Karry laughing, Jackson in poker face, and Roy shrugging...

An entertainer is usually different on and off camera.
But the three as freshmen stayed the same, while the non-verbal communications off camera stroke deeper.
It is deeply impressed in the mass interview room of the award ceremony, where the distance is much closer than on the stage.
The three had to face completely unfamiliar staff, a wall of camera, curious or even doubtful media, loads of microphones, and dazzling limelight.
They answered questions full of energy, but in the shadow of the microphones were hands clinching clothes in nervous.
After transferred to the exclusive interview room, the atmosphere softened, they had a short time to rest.
Karry helped adjusting Jackson's and Roy's clothes, then he noticed Jackson's hairs' wet, gave the trophy to Roy, and straighten up Jackson's hairs.
Jackson stood tamely with mouth compressed and eyes raised. Karry looked over after he finished, and murmured "OK".
Then Roy helped Karry evening out the neckline, and gave the trophy to him.
They turned around in a line facing the recording camera, breathed out a deep breath, and smiled full of energy.
Cohesion usually accumulates under pressure, men are grown after overcoming obstacles.
So does the tacit understandings among the boys.

## Our Thoughts, As Riders of Tides

They are students, they are teenagers, but they are already entertainers, and are already undertaking fame and popularity.
As a reporter, I don't want to make this and later interviews communications "between adult and child", but formal ones between entertainers and media.
It is a respect to them, to our interview, and to the whole community.
It is in this community that came TFBOYS, thus we in it should judge them with regular and objective views.
As there are too many cold-hearted and long-tongued beings in this world, who deny any new thing without distinguishing it, which makes new-comers here always struggling for survive.
The three popped too fast, the popularity was too frightful, and so were they called "phenomenal idols".
But those people forgot that even "phenomenal idols" had faded for a long time.
Those who question about "why they got fame" just cannot face the power of the new generation.
More new faces will emerge in this era, so we, as the riders of the tides in this field, choose to face the "possibility" on TFBOYS, choose to face the new powers, choose to have a try, choose to believe in.
