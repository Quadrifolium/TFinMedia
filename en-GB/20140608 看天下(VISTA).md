Don't know TFBoys(The Fight Boys)?
You are probably not out, but definitely old in age.
Just see how popular they are:
TFBoys recorded Happy Camp(快乐大本营, a top variety show in China) on 20th May, a scalped ticket priced 3,000 yuan at least, and topped 6,000.
After group member WANG Jun-kai(王俊凯, Karry) made a post showing his tiredness in the preparation of an exam, their fans left loads of the exam's key points below, and reposted it 270,000 times...

4th Apr., at Guangzhou's airport, a group of girls with fan group's cards were staring at the gate anxiously.
When the three boys surrounded by security guards appeared in the arrival hall, they burst out screams, bustled about shooting with their mobiles.
Everyone was pushing and shoving, left only shaking figures on the phone.

After the boys left, the fans rose the banners in hand, poured out their heart in front of a DV successively, some choked with sobs:
"You are the best I have ever seen. You don't know me, but I want to say: Don't get stressed out..."

Among the three of TFBoys, WANG Jun-kai was born in 1999, WANG Yuan(王源, Roy) and Yi Yang-qian-xi(易烊千玺, Jackson) in 2000.
When this crazy welcome at the airport happened, the mainstream media knew little about them.
Shortly after, in 15th Apr., TFBoys won the Best Group Award in Yinyue V-Chart Awards 2014(2014音悦V榜年度盛典), their fans' screaming covered many other famous singers', the MC Bowie Tsang(曾宝仪) was also surprised at their popularity.
Until now did the reporters start to realise: "Post-millennials are coming into vogue".

## Debuted, and Simply Debuted

After entering the mainstream media's view, TFBoys were frequently reported, and invited by Happy Camp.
But their manager Yuna said in calm:
"We have been gaining popularity for a long time. We were not soared suddenly."

"We have seen all kinds of idol groups and fans, TFBoys' popularity ranks among the tops."
Happy Camp's producer LUO Xin(罗昕) said.
This episode of the show, which would broadcast in 31st May, was once intended to show children and teens, as the time was close to Children's Day.
Yet, TFBoys' coming brought in top star's effect - fans arose rapidly and orderly, acted as a flash mob.

"TFBoys" stands for "The Fighting Boys", homes at Time Fengjun Entertainment(时代峰俊文化有限公司), which was obscure to the outside, had pushed out no singer or actor before.
From as early as 2011, Chongqing boys WANG Yuan and WANG Jun-kai released their covers one after another, one of the covers -- "Yige Xiang Xiatian, Yige Xiang Qiutian"("一个像夏天，一个像秋天", literally: "One Likes Summer, One Likes Autumn") was once a hot video on Weibo, and had been reposted by the original singer Christine Fan(范玮琪).
Some of these covers were simply recorded in KTV rooms, better ones were shot as MVs.
Without media's concern, they accumulated considerable fans via the Web.
Beijing boy YI Yang-qian-xi started performing in TV shows and ads from many years ago.
These three boys debuted as a group in Aug. 2013, with no conference, no press release.
One video clip named "Ten Years"(十年) was all they gave out.
This video expressed the boys' determination of chasing their dreams using ten years' endeavour.
After this simple debut, they keep releasing new songs, covers, and short plays on video sites, as a group.
One year later, at this moment, their popularity is catching up with Korean idols.

Traditionally, the process should be: the agency formally announces the debut, holds a conference, prepares the press release; the idol releases albums, performs in dramas and films; he/she will also open official Weibo page and WeChat account in these days.
This entire process remains the same for a whole century, the only change happens to the medium, which expands from newspapers, broadcasts, and films to TV and the Web.
TFBoys didn't. Before been called entertainers, they had already gained certain popularity on the Web.
It had no relationship with the agency's fame, senior entertainers' support, or media's hype.
They were, in a sense, playing with their own strength.

For those who are familiar with entertainment, from practitioners to senior fans, TFBoys confuses them a lot.
On the group's Baidu Baike(百度百科, an online encyclopaedia site in China) page, you'll see a large section listing their covers and videos with the exact release date, but it's hard to summarize their achievements.
You can't introduce them using some dramas they performed in, some popular songs they sang, some celebrities who supports them, or even some gossips they were in.

TFBoys' MVs and shows were quite simple and plain, music practitioner Mr. L considered those even be seen as "shabby":
The studio they recorded the talk shows in had just a sofa, a table, and wallpaper with floral patterns, the room they played games in had just a plain background plate and a microphone, the frames in their MVs used soft light a lot, their hairstyles and make-up were not carefully done - sometimes even the left and right eye-liners did not balance.

"But all these are not important. Or we may say, they revealed the true matters.
They didn't have plenty resources, large amount of money, grand visual effects, fine music arranging, advanced producing team, or even promotion channels.
They just uploaded videos on the Web, and many fans gathered in.
Why can they achieve all these while other practised agencies have to pour in a lot of people and money?
The price-performance ratios differ enormously.
Rather than being shocked, all practitioners should rethink what they are doing." Mr. L says.

## Who's Cultivating Whom

For an idol, good-looking is the first and a must.
Ms. Y, who operates Korean idols in China, simply concludes it as "face talks".
But TFBoys' popularity has something special.
"I can tell the natural appearances on them.
It's something not deliberately polished, which may be another feeling that some people are pursuing."
Happy Camp's producer LUO Xin said.
TFBoys in their shows, on the Web or TV, acted naturally and easily, just like students attending activities at school, with no precisely determined gestures and expressions, no strange or exaggerated hairstyles and figures, even the dance they performed was taught in school.
Their lovely smile and fresh words were real and genuine, their immature behaviours were very "meng"(萌, means cute or adorable, derived from Japanese word "moe") to many people.

LUO Xin found that there are two kinds of TFBoys' fans - "sister fans" and "mom fans".
"Sister fans" ages more or less the same as the boys, they are chasing for the looks;
"mom fans" ages a little older, they emphasize that they are witnessing the boys growth.
"Mom fans" were once referred to fans who are faithful to and much concerned about the idols, who see the idols as their own children.
TFBoys members are middle school students, they are much younger than college students and those who've stepped into society.
To "mom fans", calling the boys "sons" is indeed not too exaggerate.
Compared to these real "zheng tai"(正太, means cute pre-adolescent boys, derived from Japanese word "shota", but differs from its English meanings), post-95 fans call themselves "guai ayi"(怪阿姨, literally: "weird aunties"), while post-80s are worthy of being called "mom".

"The charm of teen idols lies not in youth, but in companionship.
Seeing them growing up from primary school to middle school, then to high school, is a sort of happiness."
A "mom fan" told Happy Camp.

This was what the agency intended. TFBoys' manager Yuna said, "Our concept is 'cultivating'."
"Cultivating" means letting the fans witness the idol's growth.
Therefore, Yuna didn't care too much about TFBoys' simple appearances and videos.
"They started off with many shortcomings, but I think this is a course of progress.
The video "Ten Years" expresses the idea that the boys achieve their dreams with endeavours, using the out-of-school time.
To the fans, it feels like their own family is growing." Yuna says.
In this way, the boys are tightly associated with inspirational image, which is very positive.

Yuna considered some idols' operation as "overdone", and won't copy them.
"TFBoys' image is always pure and fresh, like the boys next door.
And what the fans like is their natural appearances."

Unlike many other teen idols, TFBoys emphasizes they won't lag behind in study.
They are called "xue ba"(学霸, one who's score ranks top in class or school), and were doing their homework at the intervals of Happy Camp's recording.
YI Yang-qian-xi has many special talents such as musical instruments, Chinese calligraphy and painting, and had performed "Bian Lian"(变脸, literally: "face-changing", a Chinese dramatic art of Sichuan opera) in a talent show held by CCTV(中国中央电视台, China Central Television) on the Web.
They are not just pretty "zheng tai", but also pursuing so-called "all-round development of morality, intelligence, physique, aesthetic, and labour" which many Chinese value much.

Yuna doesn't want to call the boys "child stars", but "juveniles".
This word leads to one meaning that they has the possibility of reaching their golden time, of becoming top stars, around the age of 20.
There's no need to cash in this "high-quality asset" in a hurry, but slow down.
The fans see it as cultivating the idols, while in turn, the idols are patiently cultivating the fans.

## Chinese Trainees

From TFBoys, it's easy to remind us the idols from talent agencies like Johnny & Associates in Japan and S.M. Entertainment in Korea.
They are young boy groups aimed at attracting females, their fans behaves crazily.
In fact, TFBoys' home agency Time Fengjun was influenced by the idol culture of Japan and Korea.
"The training systems of Japan and Korea are very mature, while no one is doing this in China.
We think it's better to make an idol group following their modes." Yuna told us.

From 2010, the agency started recruiting trainees from schools, teaching them singing, dancing, and acting from scratch, choosing the ones who have potentials.
TFBoys' show was just an assignment of their training.
The recruiting process is a secret, but Yuna said they would communicate with the boy's parents carefully, and promise it has no impact on their study, and won't occupy their school time.

Time Fengjun is not the first.
Several other boy groups had been called "Chinese Johnnies", but faded out.
In 2012, Hunan TV(湖南卫视) launched a large project called "Up! Juniors"(向上吧！少年), positioned at "post-90s' ardent growth show", didn't attract much attention as predicted, while some media even thought it was caused by aiming at much younger participants and viewers.

A practitioner of performance operation told us that Time Fengjun had no "output" at first, but spent all the time on the training.
It pushed the trainees to the Web until their performances improved.
This special thought and acting mode formed their advantage.

Following Japan and Korea's modes, Time Fengjun clearly aimed at recruiting only boys.
"Actually, a boy group is a little easier to operate.
Girls grow much quicker, and may suddenly become quite different, which will be harder to control." Yuna said.

Time Fengjun had just started out, and doesn't have specific selecting and competing mechanism.
It just kept recruiting trainees, sifting out improper ones in time in order not to occupy their time.
"There isn't a selecting ratio, we may choose some from dozens, or choose none."

This is absolutely different from the cruel idol production lines of Japan and Korea.
Johnny & Associates of Japan selects 200 "Johnnies" from tens of thousands of boys every year, trains them with long-time and rigorous courses, but only a couple of them would be pushed out.
Korean talent agencies are well-known as "over-oppressed", with the selecting ratio of about 500:1; the trainees have just two or three hours of sleep for many years, use nutritional injection to keep strength.
These idol groups are shaped and polished with heavy sweat and hard toil.

Chinese teen idols live much better.
TFBoys members get training after school, record simple video clips.
The agency intendedly shows their immature appearances:
"It's not like Korean idols, who perform perfectly from the beginning.
They are progressing gradually, which makes the fans feel like they were growing together."
Yuna paid much attention to making TFBoys realize that "fame is a bubble", and thought that the boys are now quite good balanced in mind.
"Our boys won't put on airs.
They clearly know that it's easy to be forgotten in just several months."
And they are just common students at school.

Are they going to keep simple and natural, or get more commercialised?
Yuna said they will introduce more foreign experiences and guidance when they are getting better, and keep their natural appearances at the same time.
Even experienced producer LUO Xin had no idea of what to do.
"It's necessary to exploit a larger market with the help of commercialised operation.
But if the agency wants to maintain the boys' current appearances, maybe there lies another way."

Maybe we cannot assess TFBoys using the old light.
Post-90s have already astonished us, post-millennials are more different:
according to a survey held by Tencent Entertainment(腾讯娱乐), in today's pupils' mind, ZHANG Jie(张杰) is the top star.
TFBoys' leader WANG Jun-kai is a fan of JJ Lin(林俊杰).
He posted on Weibo after meeting Lin at the backstage of a ceremony, which says:
"I met JJ at the backstage of this ceremony. He was quite gentle, but very powerful on stage."

Hey, aunties and uncles, do you still have common words with this new generation?
