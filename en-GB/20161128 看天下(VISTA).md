> 28th November is the birthday of TFBOYS member YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson). His fans launched bountiful events around the world, many celebrations can be seen in China, America, England, Japan, Korea, and many other regions. Before that, on the birthdays of the other members, WANG Jun-kai (Karry) and WANG Yuan (Roy), there were similar storms swept. Why are these fans fanatical? What are the clues and conflicts simmering beneath the spectacles?

Due to the notable position, Times Square in Midtown Manhattan of New York City is nicknamed "The Crossroads of the World". The NASDAQ billboard on the square is known as "World's First Screen". On 22nd November, for many people passing by, they could see an oriental face on that screen, with drumsticks waving in hand. At the bottom of the screen, it reads "YI Yang-qian-xi, happy birthday."

This was not the first time TFBOYS members appear on Times Square. On the birthdays of the other members, WANG Jun-kai (Karry) and WANG Yuan (Roy), celebrating ads for them also raised concern.

"__(They are) declaring their presence on Times Square__", said Michael Galkin, sales manager of Branded Cities Network (an outdoor media corporation in America), in charge of the billboard business on Times Square. These ads were not operated by the agency of TFBOYS, but their fans. Each of the three members has their own fans, who are competing with the other factions. The supporting events [promoting events for certain celeb by fans] for the birthday of their own icon cannot be defeated by another group member's.

Not just on Times Square, the image of YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson) can also be seen on LED Screens at several airport public traffic systems, bank branches, etc. __A cruise ship at the Bund of Shanghai is entitled "YI Yang-qian-xi".__ Fans in Hong Kong and Taiwan are not lagging behind, his birthday ads are also on Chungking Mansions, Shilin Night Market, and on the body of buses. Moreover, New York is not the only place abroad with celebration. On streets in Tokyo, on buses, cinema screens, music fountain with word-spelling in Korea, on metro stations and commercial balloons in England, YI Yang-qian-xi(Jackson)'s name doesn't skip over. __His fans even bought an exclusive rose manor for him.__

Since their debut, TFBOYS sweeps across the show biz like a tornado. They dashed out, occupied Weibo, occupied WeChat, then occupied Times Squre. __They endorse China's mars exploration project, they are the target in entertainment industry, they are the most influential idol group in China.__ And for some people, the favour on them lies in the value of the power behind them – __the enormous fan community, and the extreme operation mode of the fans' supporting__.

### Supporting events: "More professional than our commercial customers"

> **What is supporting culture?**  
> In Japan and Korea, ninety-nine percent of the trainees are eliminated, S.M. Entertainment of Korea even expressed that the proportion of trainees to debuted idols is 500:1. To make one's favourite seed stay and become a real star, the fans have to exert all their efforts to make a buzz, to show the company how popular s/he is. But even if s/he debuted, that is only the beginning. S/he has numerous rivals, still has to be backed by the fans. It is like a talent show without a final. And the supporting culture is nourished in such soil.

On 25th September, 2016, Da-xi (大曦) and fellows went to a cinema in Chaoyang District of Beijing at 2:30 p.m., with dozens of gift bags. In the projection hall, *L.O.R.D.*, which TFBOYS member WANG Yuan (Roy) took part in, was about to show.

Da-xi is a "Tangyuan", which is the nickname of WANG Yuan(Roy)'s fans. The "Tangyuan" dispensing gifts are from "ROYal-Knights" (王源骑士站), a fan group for WANG Yuan (Roy), while this is one of the events they initiated for the film in ten cities across the nation. As the persons in charge for off-line events in Beijing, Da-xi and several other members of the fan group has visited many cinemas in Beijing one week earlier, to investigate the capacity, the traffic around, and other issues, for selecting the most suitable place.

Such a fan group [also called "station"] is often found by a loyal fan, acts as the main force in supporting events. The founder should spend costly money from his/her own pocket, which indicates they have sufficient economic strength. In the age of social network, to register a Weibo account can be the birth of a fan group, but more skills and stronger abilities are required in its running.

There are hundreds of fan groups about TFBOYS focusing on various fields. For example, __"THRONE" (问鼎) is adept at spirited and passionate words, "TF Daily" (TF日报) updates the news of the three members, "TFB-Golliwog" (脑洞站) is skilled at making facial expressions, "TFAlexander" provides audios and videos in high quality, "TFMedical" (医援会) shares health tips with TFBOYS and the fans,__ etc.

The Pale (苍白少年), the role WANG Yuan (Roy) plays in the film *L.O.R.D.* (爵迹; Legend of Ravaging Dynasties)

With *L.O.R.D.* running from October, all fan groups for WANG Yuan (Roy) aroused and started to take actions. They advertised WANG Yuan(Roy)'s promotion video for one week, on over 5,000 LED screens at 472 pop cinemas in 70 cities. While at the same time, organisers held off-line events at the same time in 10 cities. They also published the photos and videos from the event onto Weibo, to "heat up" the promotion on-line. TiHE Communication (泰和传播) ran the carpet-spreading promotion plan with "ROYal-Knights". CAO Xiao-lei (曹萧磊), CMO of TiHE, admitted that "__I think they (the fans) are more professional in this field.__"

When two managers of "ROYal-Knights" found TiHE, CAO Xiao-lei didn't take it seriously at first. "Words, such as 'overdosed', came to my mind easily," CAO Xiao-lei said, "but through the contact, I found they are a professional planning team."

These two post-1990 girls presented a 30-page planning case, which shows that TiHE is lack of influence among young people, while this plan just aims at them, and fills up the short batten. "They knew our sore spot clearly, and expressed what they can bring to us explicitly." CAO Xiao-lei said, __their plan is written in detail, the dates, tempo, and methods are all determined__. "It makes me feel that they are afraid of being judged as inexperienced. In fact, they are more professional than our commercial customers in many aspects."

Activists of such events are mostly young people in their first years in working society. Though many fans call themselves "mum fans", they are not much elder than the three members. __They mainly come from large cities, are well-educated, have specialised knowledge in various subjects.__

*L.O.R.D.* is only a small part of the supporting events. From September, the birthdays of the three members of TFBOYS were coming in succession, the fans started to prepare for the battle of the celebration competition. Besides birthdays, the vanity gained from other kinds of competitions also makes it hard to extricate themselves. The fans pay the support for their icon from common people, and transform birthday celebration into a ritual.

### Lurking scheme: The riddle of ¥100,000,000

WANG Jun-kai(Karry)'s birthday celebrating video on Times Square, in September

WANG Jun-kai (Karry) is the first to spend his birthday among TFBOYS. Just like YI Yang-qian-xi(Jackson)'s in recent days, the fans of WANG Jun-kai(Karry)'s have also carried out worldwide actions.

Taiwan is one of the region. From 21st September, fan group "KARRYFOCUS" (王俊凯基地站) advertised on platforms of Taipei Metro for a week. The whole process is not an easy task, especially the censorship of the content.

"__Simplified Chinese characters are prohibited.__" XIANG Hong, a person in charge in "KARRYFOCUS", said that not only the subtitle, even the characters in the photos are censored. In addition, the elements shown are also filtered. "We would like to show the two meetings Karry attended in the Great Hall of the People. But among the reported materials, they failed to pass."

WANG Jun-kai(Karry)'s birthday celebration advertised in *Morgunblaðið* (*The Morning Paper* in Iceland)

Away from the hot spots, WANG Jun-kai(Karry)'s fans also advertised on half a page of Morgunblaðið (*The Morning Paper* in Iceland). The only reason is – __WANG Jun-kai (Karry) has mentioned that he wants to travel in Iceland.__ "We are also curious," Maria Liljagaga, an employee in advertising department of the newspaper, told us that they had never met such a case. In her view, "__it is like performance art__".

Information shows that Morgunblaðið is a well-known newspaper founded in 1913 by the brother of the first president of Iceland. The circulation of the newspaper and the page view of the website are among the leading positions of the country.

Maria said, the contact about the transnational advertising lasted over a week, mainly via e-mails and phone calls. Though it's an interesting case, "we didn't talk about it with anyone before the publication on that day," Maria said, because his fans cared very much about secrecy, "the man who was contacting with us told us not to make it public beforehand."

Maria didn't tell us the price of the ad, while all the fan groups for TFBOYS are reluctant to reply such questions. As to the expense of the supporting events people are wondering, the interviewed founders gave similar answer: __The funds are raised from fans__. However, some fans exposed in private that many fan groups have sold souvenirs about TFBOYS, mostly on Taobao.

"They sell T-shirts, cards, and such. Anyway, they print the photos they've taken on all kinds of commodities. After all, different fan groups have different photos." Si-gua (丝瓜), a girl fan and senior in college, told us that fan groups always try to make an event grand and impressive, "they earn money to carry out better supports for the icon."

The merchandise from fan groups has no authorization from the agency of TFBOYS, is suspected of infringing. Thus, the managers of fan groups guard the secret of the money earned and spent. "__Fans have huge conflicts at present, we won't publicise the expenses in detail__," XIANG Hong said, they hope people don't focus on this issue, "people may think we waste too much money just for a celeb," which would create a bad influence.

Rely on the sensation, these fan groups can make privileged bargains from advertising companies. CAO Xiao-lei from TiHE told us, they targeted the massive influence of TFBOYS, in the hope of promoting their brand. Therefore, the price offered to the fan group for WANG Yuan (Roy) is nearly 50% discounted – less than 1 million for 5,000 LED screens.

Birthday blessing to WANG Jun-kai (Karry) on a train of Chongqing Metro

It is widely spread that WANG Jun-kai(Karry)'s fans have spent ten million yuan on the ad in Chongqing Metro. XIANG Hong denied the statement, __"I don't know who paid the press release. But the ad in metro is not worth ten million yuan, but only several hundreds of thousands of yuan. That's too exaggerated."__

XIANG Hong had heard from the advertising agency than such a release caused huge controversy. "The fan circle of TFBOYS is quite complicated. It's like the case of other celebs: Pay for some press releases to press negative impacts on you … We know clearly who is possible to initiate it, but to say it out will cause new conflicts. So we have to hold back."

XIANG Hong's words revealed the other side of TFBOYS' fans. These fans are not friendly in the circle, they even slander the other factions. __In fan jargon, those in favour of the whole group are called "group fans", those of one member are "only fans" (biased fans), those of two are "coupling fans".__ As to TFBOYS, the biased fans of each member and the coupling fans of Karry and Roy overwhelm the voice of "group fans". "Group fans" of TFBOYS are called "Clovers", use orange as the supporting colour; biased fans of WANG Jun-kai (Karry) are "Crabs" in blue; that of WANG Yuan (Roy) are "Tangyuan" in green; that of YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson) are "Paper Cranes" in red.

Just like a religion, many sects stand erectly in the fan circle. There are three sects in "monotheism" and one in "polytheism", in which the believers are waging protracted and entangled religious wars. The biased fans believed in "polytheism" is no doubt the leading propeller on promoting the influence of the group. The more and more blockbusting birthday celebration is a reflection of the lurking scheme among sects.

### Chongqing: "Fans are gathering!"

On 17th October, security line was arranged around the auditorium of Chongqing Nankai Middle School at 5 p.m. The crowd was stopped two metres away, and security guards were watching behind. When someone tried to cross, the guards would be in alert and urge the people to leave. Ten minutes later, a person in charge lead staff into the auditorium from the north, and waved his arm, "WANG Yuan(Roy)'s fans are gathering!" This is the sign of getting ready for security.

The person in charge said, to take such a big action, "one reason is of WANG Yuan (Roy), the other is that the auditorium is small." __People are passionate because they rarely see him. Even the classmates of WANG Yuan (Roy) only saw him once, on the first day he became a student here.__

Due to the busy performing events, WANG Yuan (Roy) asked for a long-time leave after enrolled in September, had never returned thereafter. When this singing was finished, the students had to wait until the final exams come in December. Since he wasn't at school for a long time, he doesn't have a seat in the classroom. A classmate said, "__If he comes for study, he has to place a desk and a chair by the dais.__"

WANG Yuan(Roy)'s teacher doesn't know him. "I have made no contact with him. He's working, he's on a leave." Mr. Jin (金), the head teacher of the class, said that in his eyes, WANG Yuan (Roy) kept a low profile, "he's just a common student. On that day, he wrote his name on the blackboard and said 'I am WANG Yuan'. Then, the other students smiled. That's all."

At 7:40 p.m., WANG Yuan (Roy) got on stage and sang. He's in black coat, seemed a little reserved. The fans gathered outside the security line at the west of the auditorium quieted down, recognising the voice carefully. A parent took out a mobile to watch the live signal from within. WANG Yuan(Roy)'s figure came out, though the mobile had a cracked screen and a poor speaker, several girl fans were surrounding. Two of them had mouth covered with hand, nearly burst out tears.

WANG Yuan(Roy)'s sixteenth birthday party, "Meeting You", held in Changsha, on 8th November, 2016

The branch of Time Fengjun (时代峰峻) in Chongqing, which TFBOYS was in, sits in Changjiang International Office Building (长江国际写字楼) in Nanbin Road. A clerk of a coffee shop in the building told us, more fans of TFBOYS come in weekends, "I start working at 8 a.m. and leave at 5:30 p.m. They come earlier and leave later." She has only seen WANG Yuan (Roy) once, when fans were screaming. A fan was running behind, tumbled twice but didn't give up. She has also seen a fan of WANG Jun-kai (Karry) once, who were carrying a bag, eating bread under the dazzling sun, wandering for days near the building, claiming that WANG Jun-kai (Karry) told her to wait there.

All the three members were trainees Time Fengjun recruited. In 2010, LI Fei (李飞), a businessman in real estate started a team of over twenty people in Chongqing. He intended to follow the cultivating mode of __the legend in star-making in Japan – Johnny & Associates__, recruit boys aged 10 to 12, take training in singing and dancing in their spare time, and make a domestic teen idol group from them. __The boys have a collective name – TF Family, in which "TF" means "The Fighting".__ [Translator's note: In fact, "TF" comes from the name of the agency – "Time Fengjun". When TFBOYS got its name, the meaning is composed afterwards.]

Many agencies have claimed to be Chinese Johnny, but nearly all of them disappeared after several press releases and recruiting. Time Fengjun had no network or resource in the field. They just discarded the traditional route, started from recording daily training time with hand-held camera.  The frames were swaying, and seldom edited or embellished. The videos were published on the web, as the only channel for promotion. But it is exactly such "unaffected sense" which made TF Family different from numerous entertainers came from star-making assembly lines. The immature words and deeds assembled a batch of followers on a video danmaku (弾幕) site.

On Children's Day in 2013, TF Family published the video covering *Onion* (洋葱) by WANG Jun-kai (Karry) and WANG Yuan (Roy). Later, it was reposted by Ashin (阿信), the singer of the band Mayday (五月天), which is the composer of *Onion*. The video spread quickly. With the help of this trend, Time Fengjun selected WANG Jun-kai (Karry) and WANG Yuan (Roy), and took YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson) from Beijing in, formed TFBOYS which debuted in August.

### Cultivation: The division of "mum fans" and "hounding fans"

![Image](http://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_png/8S67SzX3z3BCrufBiaribCMtrDGBhnZADicEn2wSqTCQAu2icI3B8RgjicQFicKzsplmclqMJvp4j8yKW6gHxXnnzcyg/0)

The iconic event of TFBOYS' debut is a promotion video called "Ten Years", in which they promised with the fans on striving for ten years: "__No matter from eight to eighteen, or from eighteen to twenty-eight, we have ten years to go. Even if failed, we are closer to the dream.__"

"Nŭlì" [努力: make great efforts; try hard; exert oneself.] is a gilded signboard soliciting new fans. Despite the crudeness of the videos from the agency, the scenes of WANG Jun-kai (Karry) and WANG Yuan (Roy) crying when stretching ligaments are always mentioned, YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson) dancing and writing calligraphy from four-year-old is also referred to, followed by his experience in contests skimmed over. A question the fans often ask is, "do you know their endeavour?" With the word "Nŭlì" (努力), Time Fengjun and the fans of TFBOYS drove the supporting culture from Japanese and Korean sensation to the peak.

"__Many fans of TFBOYS were drawn from Korean idol groups. They are doing things exactly like in Korean fan circle.__" Xiao-wen, TFBOYS' fan and a master degree candidate of a college in Nanjing, told us. Owing to the conflicts among fan sects of TFBOYS, they seldom judge biased fans of another icon in front of media people. Even if someone made comments, s/he will ask for being anonymous.

Xiao-wen didn't like TFBOYS at first, even a little averse to them. "Later, I saw some insults and abuses at them from adults, but the boys just did nothing wrong. They are humble and polite, gentle like a jade. I thought I should do something, and started to quarrel with malicious people around me. And I gradually became a fan …" Xiao-wen recalled his transformation.

One day, Xiao-wen even had tears shed when watching a video about YI Yang-qian-xi(Jackson)'s growth. "The girls aside got stunned. After all, as a strapping man, it seems illogical for me to weep for a teenager. So they regarded me as a paedophile." Xiao-wen recalled on Zhihu [知乎, a website], "it's the sentiment from my heart. Perhaps it's their persistence which attract my attention, but the favour is becoming more."

Just like what they are mocking themselves, these fans are witnessing the growth of the idols. This mode of cultivation brought about "mum fans", which was rarely seen in domestic show biz. __"Mum fans" have no relationship with the age. Any fan who is loyal to and concern about the idol, who cherish the idol as his/her "son", can be taken as a "mum fan", including boy fans like Xiao-wen.__

Not a few "mum fans" are highly educated people like Xiao-wen. "__Star chasing is a kind of emotional appeal. Highly educated people also need it, as they are human beings.__" Xiao-wen told us, people have various reasons in star chasing, someone may have discovered some trait on the star, which is just what they are lack of. While some others bear romantic fantasies on them, even sexual fantasy, "__as far as I know, such sexual fantasy is not unusual among female fans of TFBOYS.__"

There is also a group of fans which is unfamiliar to many – "hounding fans" [fans who interferes the private life of idols]. They pay excessive concern on the private life of the idols. In order to satisfy the selfish desire, they often resort to tailing after, candid snaps, etc. WANG Yuan(Roy)'s school, Chongqing Nankai Middle School, has even altered the opening-up convention on account of frequent intrusion from "hounding fans", which had disturbed the teachers and students markedly.

Speaking of "hounding fans", a manager of "WANG Yuan Panda" (王源熊猫站) said with indignation, "for some time, he (WANG Yuan; Roy) was always running to and from school by the road, with many 'hounding fans' tailing after. As it's too dangerous, we have complained to the agency, and denounced the fans several times." However, it's hard to make a clear division between a fan and a "hounding fan". "It's hard to define," Jun-jun (君君) said, __the crucial distinction is whether the action could make trouble for the idol or people around him__. As a fan group, they "are also spreading the concept and stressing the severity, to let people understand."

### *Jianghu*: Immersed too deep to have original intention forgotten

![Image](http://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_png/8S67SzX3z3BCrufBiaribCMtrDGBhnZADicHZnzNbBzh3Xun62ibn3nejIUnkvMAyHffHaagHuNWXxkYjw4GwQEycw/0)  
TFBOYS recording *Happy Camp*, on 23rd March, 2015

On 23rd March, 2015, in the recording of *Happy Camp* (快乐大本营) in Hunan TV (湖南卫视), WANG Jun-kai (Karry) forgot a move in dancing, and YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson) pulled him from the back as a reminder. WANG Jun-kai (Karry) didn't react in time and staggered a little, then got the sign and changed the position. Such a thing is very common during recording, but it caused __a typical war between two sects of biased fans__.

Someone made an animated picture in slow motion as the evidence that "YI Yang-qian-xi plucked WANG Jun-kai", which caused a great stir quickly. __WANG Jun-kai(Karry)'s fans in rage excavated the names and identity card numbers of the family of YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson) and posted them on the web, then YI Yang-qian-xi(Jackson)'s fans revenged by putting WANG Jun-kai(Karry)'s QQ number and phone number in public.__

TFBOYS is currently the only group debuted in Time Fengjun, and is the only dominance in domestic boy band circle, with no rival at the same position. But the open rivalry and veiled strife among the fans become the biggest trouble.

"__There are three people singing and dancing and performing, clashes are inevitable.__ Every fan is arguing that his icon must be more emphasised, and dislikes glimpsing the other two." Xiao-wen said, "on one hand, their image positions coincide in some aspects; on the other hand, the agency may have lead such conflicts in fan circle on purpose. After all, hatred has stronger power than love, can burst out mightier energy, and is able to boost the popularity fast."

In the evening of 22nd October, "YI Yang-qian-xi Micro Board" (易烊千玺微吧) published a pre-notice on the cooperation with Micro Mag (微刊), a mobile information app. On the next day, "WANG Yuan Panda" (王源熊猫站) inquired relevant issues through journalists of our office, and expressed the wish of promoting WANG Yuan(Roy)'s new solo song composed by JJ Lin (林俊杰). Its manager Jun-jun said, the agency cannot avoid being partial on managing the images of the members, and the fans can win over resources for their icon.

__In the fan circle of TFBOYS, there's no objection on the fact that biased fans override group fans.__ Meanwhile, fans from different sects isolate by impassable chasm. "I saw a fan group for YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson) on public weal in Nanjing, and applied to join. The inspector watched my Weibo posts, and asked why I reposted messages about WANG Jun-kai (Karry). I said I'm a group fan." Xiao-wen recalled, the inspector stated that they only invite biased fans for YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson), "__I questioned that as she can also like ZHANG Yi-xing (张艺兴), why I can't like other members of the same group. She told me it is a matter of principle.__"

Third anniversary fan meeting of TFBOYS, in August, 2016

Under the acknowledgement post from the official Weibo account of TFBOYS, the hot comments section is occupied by biased fans for all the members. While under the posts of the official account of Time Fengjun, biased fans are abusing and condemning. Jun-jun said, it probably came from the fact that Time Fengjun only responded in time on problems the fans made big. "__There rumours a false reasoning that the squeaking wheel gets the oil.__"

On 25th October, the official Weibo account of "Weibo Fan Festival" (粉丝嘉年华) released a statement of apology to the fans of YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson) and of WANG Jun-kai (Karry). The origin is that the fans of YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson) asserted that the organiser changed the cut-off time of the vote for "Star Influence Chart" (明星势力榜). The statement explains that the cut-off time is set to 30th September, "due to the mistake in communication, the private message sent by the Weibo account delivered the time falsely to 25th October."

The haggling over the cut-off arose from the calculation of the chart, which took interaction, adoration value, posts mentioned, and search index into account. The adoration value can be pushed up using money, while the other items relied on long-term accumulation. According to the rule, one adoration is worth 1 yuan. In order to top the chart, the fans of YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson) and of WANG Jun-kai (Karry) started an intense competition. If it cut off on 30th September, WANG Jun-kai (Karry) lead in adoration; if it cut off on 25th October, each of them gained over five million, but YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson) exceeded about 600,000.

The fans of YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson) surmised that this is a deal from Time Fengjun on boosting WANG Jun-kai (Karry) and suppressing YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson). Even sayings like "agency paid ¥300,000" and "agency asks for postpone" were circulating on Weibo. Then, the fans of WANG Jun-kai (Karry) turned impatient, tried to prove that it's a deserved prize, that the fans of YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson) are spreading "rumours".

Fans started to abuse and denounce, a competition using real money became a "scheming plot" at last. "Weibo Fan Festival" had to emphasise that Time Fengjun was not involved, and the agency "is not partial to any entertainer in any way," but the comments on Weibo shows that many fans are not convinced.

"The fan circle is becoming more and more disordered. It's easy to commit speech crime. You made an ordinary post, someone would come and criticise that you are an 'anti fan', sketch fabricated vision with his/her runaway mind, then condemn publicly on Weibo, abuse with dirty words, or even resort to actions in real life to threaten you." Xiao-wen said, "__On one side, it originates from the concern about and love for the idol, that they take actions for their icon; on the other side, they are deeply immersed in the affections, and taken spending money as the proof of their love.__" Xiao-wei also suspected that it may be the hype by some fan groups for appealing the crowd. "Perhaps – I mean perhaps – some fan groups make use of the followers on Weibo to make money. Not just fan groups for different members are battling, those for a certain member are also rivals."

One day in August, 2014, *People In News* (新闻当事人) of Hunan TV were interviewing fans waiting for their icons during the recording of a variety show. When asked why you like TFBOYS, they rushed to the front to tell their story –

"I also liked singing when I was a child, and had danced for years. But I didn't persist in."

"I have received training in many skills, but stopped later."

__The fans are not simply adoring the three members of TFBOYS, but rather guarding another self in a parallel world who is persistent on practised skills and getting attention focused.__

But the complicated fan circle are annoying them. A "coupling fan" said frankly, "__you can get a lot of support and praise with one post, you can get all kinds of attacks and abuses with one comment. Whether you are chasing the circle or the star itself is becoming vague.__ I feel tired. Appreciate in peace is enough. People are immersed too deep to have original intention forgotten."
