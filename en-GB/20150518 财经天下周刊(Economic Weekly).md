As the first popular group in China born on the Internet, TFBOYS maximised the power of the web.
Beyond the popularity, there comes the time of Internet stars and reshaping of the entire fan economy.

TFBOYS, formed by three boys aged only 15 on average, is now one of the most popular groups in mainland China.

YI Yang-qian-xi  
Member, born on 28th Nov. 2000 in Huaihua, Hunan, debuted with WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan as TFBOYS in 2013.

Though traffic jams are common in Beijing, the congestion on the highways around MasterCard Centre might be beyond your imagination.
The cars could hardly move two or three metres in several minutes.

This jam was caused by three boys aged 15 and 16.

It was 2 P.M. of 11th Apr., five hours before the third Yinyuetai Award Ceremony, but there's already thousands of people gathering around the stadium.

Most of them were females aged over 20, who called themselves "Clovers", each one took some products with idols' names, most of which had "TFBOYS" on it.
This is one of the most popular idol groups in mainland China, among the members, leader WANG Jun-kai was born in 1999, while the other two members WANG Yuan and YI Yang-qian-xi were born in 2000.
These fans came from all over China, only for seeing and supporting these "little" stars.

The subway station near the stadium had been occupied by scalpers.
They kept asking young people walking out the station: "Need a ticket? To see TFBOYS' show."

From 4 P.M., audience with tickets entered the stadium successively, "Clovers" became the largest and the most active group.
During the warm-up, when an emcee asked, "whom do you want to see?"

"TFBOYS!" The yell resounded.

Echoing with the Internet which is subverting everything, inside and outside the stadium, "Clovers" held their mobiles all the time, checking their Friend Circles and Weibo.
Dozens of temporary booths hung posters with QR codes, promoting the fan clubs they affiliated with or the apps related.

At that night, the live web casting of the ceremony was viewed 500,000 times, received 800,000 comments.
While the peak value of the views and comments all happened when TFBOYS were on stage.
This young idol group came on stage three times, and won three awards.
Near the end of the ceremony, TFBOYS got 8-minute performance, which is the longest that night.
They sang "Young" and "The Manual of Youth" and showed a dance solo.
They wore black coats, white shirts, and white trousers, from their first appearance, screaming followed with every minute TFBOYS were on stage.

"TFBOYS time" climaxed when they were singing "The Manual of Youth".
In the last year, this song spread around streets, was called "addictive".
When the background music of the song started, the audience shouted "TFBOYS" in rhythm.
TFBOYS were infected by the enthusiasm of "Clovers", bowed many times to audience, and said,
"no matter what happened, TFBOYS will accompany with 'Clovers' for ten years."

Such passionate scene is not uncommon for TFBOYS.
In fact, every time they perform or appear in public, the fans pursue crazily.
But beyond expectations, they only debuted over one year
-- on 6th Aug. 2013, TFBOYS was just pushed out by Beijing Time Fengjun.

"TFBOYS" means "The Fighting Boys", most of their music works were published on the Internet.
Besides music, the agency produced variety show "TF Teens GO!"(TF少年GO！) and short play "Study Room in Boys' School"(男生学院自习室).

As been seen as one of the push factor behind TFBOYS, ZHANG Dou(张斗), the president and CEO of Yinyuetai, interpreted the group as the first "Internet Star" in China.
__"TFBOYS were born on the Internet, their fans were mainly active on the Internet, the qualitative leap of their influence was backed by the Internet."__ said ZHANG.

### The Prologue

No only TFBOYS, Time Fengjun was a talent agency relying on the Internet per se.
It regarded the Internet as the most important channel during the star-making process.

"In the development of TFBOYS, the network platform acted a significant role."
A leader of Time Fengjun told us, the fans were young, so the agency would like to choose channels for youths to promote TFBOYS.

From 2009, Time Fengjun started publishing videos of the trainees on Weibo and video sites.
At that time, the agency intended to get preliminary assessments from netizens, and the whole group of trainees were called "TF Family".
The agency's smart at weighing the value of each trainee through those videos on the web, instead of judging by itself like traditional talent agencies.

From the second half of 2011, Time Fengjun regularly released cover videos of WANG Jun-kai and others.
To the agency, these attempts brought in surprising results.
In 2012, WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan's cover of "Yige Xiang Xiatian, Yige Xiang Qiutian"(一个像夏天，一个像秋天, literally: "One Likes Summer, One Likes Autumn") caused the first extensive attention.
This video had been reposted over 80,000 times on Sina Weibo, and was viewed over 5 million times up to September 2012.

"Clover" Xiao-mian-li knew WANG Yuan and WANG Jun-kai at a dinner party, when her friend found the video for her.
Her first impression is that the boys were quite plain at singing, but the looks still attracted her.
Like many other "Clovers", Xiao-mian-li started paying attention to their Weibo accounts, and searching for their covers on video sites.

Time Fengjun didn't disappoint these early supporters, more cover videos were published on the web.
Thereafter, WANG Yuan and WANG Jun-kai covered songs like "Dang Ai Yi Cheng Wangshi"(当爱已成往事, literally: "When Love Becomes the Past") and "Yangcong"(洋葱, Onion). These songs were not only hot on Weibo and video sites, but also reposted by the original singers.
The cover video of "Yangcong" was recommended by Ashin(阿信) from Taiwan, and broadcast on CTi TV(中天電視, Chung T'ien Television) as a hot topic.
After the stir, the followers of WANG Jun-kai's Weibo account increased from 20,000 to 150,000 in one week.

The time from July 2011 to August 2013 was seen as the period when TFBOYS initially finished the primitive accumulation of fans.
During the period, though wasn't debuted, the boys already had reasonable number of fans, Weibo and Youku[a video site] were the most important channel for the agency.

FENG Jun(冯珺), the senior analyst of Yi'en(艺恩), regarded 2004 as the first tide of on-line music in China,
while Weibo, WeChat, and other mobile apps met explosive development opportunity around 2010, which made a new way of star-making possible in channel and technique.

Comparing the developing of Time Fengjun and Weibo, it's easy to tell that the time the agency started promoting trainees on Weibo was exactly when such an Internet product came into mainstream's sight.
Sina released beta version of "Sina Weibo" in August 2009, when the boys' cover videos caused much attention in 2012 and 2013, it's exactly the golden age of Weibo.
Till 2013, the number of users of Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo was over 1.04 billion.

The popularity on platform like Weibo made the influence of TFBOYS ferment rapidly.
Soon, TFBOYS upgraded on Yinyuetai, the biggest music video site in China.

In March 2014, TFBOYS' new MV "Magic Castle" was released and appeared on V-Chart of Yinyuetai.
Yinyue V-Chart is an instant updating music chart according to views, plays, favourites on Yinyuetai, and data from several sites including Sina and Renren.com.
TFBOYS ranked the first when appeared on the chart for the first time, which astonished the staff of Yinyuetai.

ZHANG Dou hadn't heard of the group at that time, the strangeness made him surprised at the result.
Based on previous experience, it's already a difficult task for new groups or musicians to be on the top 10,
and the position of top 3 always belonged to A-list stars from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China, or hot groups like SJ and EXO from Korea.

The surprise soon turned to suspicion.
There were some stars who tried to cheat on the data to gain more attention, Yinyuetai banned the deals decisively.
Hence, ZHANG Dou asked the team to check if TFBOYS did the same.

The result surprised ZHANG Dou very much:
All the data of TFBOYS were recorded due to normal activities, there's no cheating.
But ZHANG was still doubtful, he could not understand why can a group he never heard of top the chart when appeared on it for the first time.
He wanted to know more about TFBOYS.
To his surprise, there were some fans of TFBOYS in the company, and they were excited at telling him who they are, and why did they like them.

__This is the first time ZHANG Dou felt the subversion of entertainment industry from the Internet:
the transparent and open environment makes the decision power transfer from agencies or big shots to the mass.__

Not only that, TFBOYS didn't stop surprising ZHANG Dou.

In April 2014, the vote for "The Popular Singer in Yinyue Live" was under way at the same time of the ceremony.
By convention, this award selects the most popular star or group via on-line interaction (sending virtual flowers to the star) when the annual ceremony is on air.
The momentum of TFBOYS was strong from the beginning, they and SJM were neck and neck.
SJM is a male group of S.M. Entertainment debuted in 2007, HAN Geng(韩庚) was once a member.

Actually, TFBOYS' attendance in the ceremony was already an unexpected affair.
A leader of Time Fengjun said, the agency was very surprised at Yinyuetai's invitation, because it had no cooperation with Yinyuetai before, and TFBOYS debuted only seven months.

ZHANG Dou was more surprised that as the deadline gets nearer, TFBOYS got a little more votes, and the advantage was enlarging.

When the vote ended, ZHANG Dou received an urgent call from a staff who counts the vote.
The staff told ZHANG with inconceivable tone that the vote for TFBOYS exceeded, and asked whether it would be better to present the award to SJM, because it was a world-class group after all.

ZHANG Dou was totally entangled:
Awarding to TFBOYS may be very risky, but awarding to SJM violates the principle.
His heart was beating fast, it's difficult for him to tell whether it is reliable to bet the most important award on a seven-month new group.
He must make the decision in several seconds, because the ceremony was waiting for his reply.

"To TFBOYS."

It's hard for ZHANG to remember the mental activity when he said the words.
After hung up the call, he was scared.
He knew it was a bet, but he wanted to bet on the boys who's younger than his child, whom he only met for the first time at the backstage.

They are handsome, exuberant, somewhat childish, polite to seniors, very popular on the web
-- This was the only impression of ZHANG to TFBOYS.

The result of the bet was partly in ZHANG's expectation:
TFBOYS who defeated SJM in the award of "Yinyue Live" quickly came into the sight of the public.
In the following days, TFBOYS were always in top 3 of Baidu Search Index.
The result was partly unexpected:
TFBOYS went to fame like a rocket, after being curious about TFBOYS, people started wondering what they would do next.

After one year, ZHANG Dou was grateful at his choice.
He replayed the critical seconds in his mind for times -- what if he awarded SJM?

But history has no hypothesis.

### Fission Effect

A leader of Time Fengjun regarded the award as a chance for the fans of TFBOYS to break their power out.
"The early fans of TFBOYS are accumulated from multiple platforms, the ceremony released the power of the fans."

However, __sometimes at present, ZHANG Dou still thinks the popularity of TFBOYS inconceivable__.
But he was gradually clear about the fact that though TFBOYS was not so famous before the awards, they already gained a lot of fans from platforms like Weibo, video sites, Baidu Tieba, and QQ Groups.
"The thickness of their fans in the early stage was beyond compare, to many stars."

As early as 2013, there was a fan who recognised WANG Yuan at an airport before he's popular.
WANG Yuan and his mother were waiting at the hall due to the delay, the fan made full use of the time to chat with him.
It surprised his mother very much, as she didn't realise that her son was popular.

Also in 2013, TFBOYS released the first E.P.(mini album).
There's a sentence in the lyrics of the song "HEART": Clovers will blossom in the future.
Cherished with the expectation of the members and the lucky meaning of clover, __the fans of TFBOYS called themselves "Clovers"__.
"Clovers" launched fan activities quite early, the initial ones were interacting on Weibo or going to their school hoping to get close to them.
Up to now, there's no unified organisation for "Clovers", __they set up hundreds of fan clubs, the larger ones contains thousands of fans, the smaller ones dozens__.

Ha-ni Xiao-xiong(Honey Bear) is an organiser of a fan club, this is a loose group with over 1,000 fans from around China and even overseas students.
They usually chat or organise activities in QQ Group or WeChat Group.

Inside the club, the fans joined before 2014 are conventionally called seniors,
they are those who like TF Family from WANG Yuan and WANG Jun-kai's videos in 2012 and 2013,
many of them have a special folder in their computer with early videos of TFBOYS downloaded from Youku.

QQ Group was the best sharing platform for resources and information at the early stage.
Ha-ni Xiao-xiong purchased for VIP particularly to enlarge the shared space of the group, to store videos.
Several seniors had posted TFBOYS' activities in the group for half a year.

As an early "Clover", Ha-ni Xiao-xiong was seen as "the encyclopaedia of TFBOYS" in the club.
She was a junior at the department of Chinese, the first thing in the morning was checking the latest news of TFBOYS with mobile on the bed.
She intended to make a weekly newspaper about TFBOYS but finally gave up, because the information on the web was already sufficient.

Sometimes, Ha-ni Xiao-xiong would launch a quiz about TFBOYS.
The rule is: answer without searching the web.
She won nearly every time, except once been asked TFBOYS' first show on TV, she answered "Happy Camp", but was wrong.

After that, Ha-ni Xiao-xiong searched the members' show on TV carefully.
To her surprise, WANG Yuan had sang in "Golden Age"(黄金年代) of Anhui TV, YI Yang-qian-xi had danced in some children's programmes.
She hadn't noticed about all these TV shows.
Not only she, many "Clovers" were unaware that their idols had performed on TV much earlier.
The Internet was nearly the only channel "Clovers" know about TFBOYS.

What they didn't know is that Time Fengjun didn't focus on the Internet from the beginning.
At first, the agency executed both in traditional way and on the Internet.
WANG Jun-kai had attended several TV programmes on child stars with little effects.
These programmes improved nearly nothing at his popularity.

The agency had analysed the "attempts on TV", a leader thought that the members of TF Family were different from ordinary child stars on TV.
"What we cultivates are teen idols, not traditional child stars, so the Internet should be our main platform."

In some sense, it's the way different from being debuted from traditional talent shows on TV that brought TFBOYS a huge number of fans.
"There's a fission effect on the Internet:
If you gathered the first 1,000 fans, they may fissure continuously, faster and larger than any traditional TV or media can make."
SHI Ying(时颖), the co-founder of Yinyuetai said,
she had talked with a director of a famous talent show on TV, the director joked that he directed talent shows for many years, never thought of a new group being popular without television.

### Ten Internet Skills

"He's very prudent and mysterious."
Practitioners in music industry who know Mr. LI (he's unwilling to have the name on media), the master of Time Fengjun, all describe him as "prudent" and "mysterious".

Mr. LI set up the talent agency due to optimistic in entertainment.
After TFBOYS' famous, Mr. LI had never accepted any interview, and seldom engaged in social activities or free talks with partners.

"The popularity of TFBOYS is out of his expectation."
An anonymous music company senior said, he had asked Mr. LI whether he was in anticipation of TFBOYS' popularity, Mr. LI replied without hesitation: I've never thought of it.

Nevertheless, from the development of TFBOYS, it's easy to tell that Mr. LI and Time Fengjun had clear skills and thoughts.
In the trend of Internet star-making, Time Fengjun formed ten particular skills via TFBOYS.

① Find grass-root freshmen from the Internet

"We don't push out those only the agency thinks promising any more, but are more favourable to grass-root freshmen popular on Internet platforms like YouTube.
The popularity means they satisfy the real needs. Hoyamatsu Yasuhito(保屋松靖人), the head of Financial Affairs of Avex Group told us, in Japan, Avex Group and other large talent agencies started recruiting from Internet platforms like YouTube as early as ten years ago.
Though the music and fan market in China formed later than Korea and Japan, the overall trend is the same.

Time Fengjun introduced the practice.
From 2009, it got preliminary assessments of its trainees from netizens.
Inside the agency, they had evaluated the popularity of all the trainees.
The videos, art photos, make-up photos, and daily photos of the trainees were released on several websites, and the numbers of views, downloads, and reposts were recorded.
The most important factor of WANG Jun-kai, WANG Yuan, and YI Yang-qian-xi's being in TFBOYS is that they ranked the top at the evaluation.

② Rely on the Internet, not traditional TV stations

Many insiders compare TFBOYS with RTA, which was a teen group debuted around 2010.
The members of RTA were also handsome boys and talented in music and dance.
Hunan TV played an utterly important role in the debut and growing of RTA, it can be said that RTA was born in "Day Day Up"(天天向上) of Hunan TV, and gathered much popularity through "Shaonian Chengzhang Shuo"(少年成长说) [It was called "Shaonian Jinhualun"(少年进化论, literally: "Evolution of Teenagers") later] of Hunan TV.

This disbanded group differed from TFBOYS that it promoted via traditional TV stations, not the Internet.
"From 2010 to 2013, RTA appeared on many programmes, but it excessively relied on TV, had no actions on the Internet."
Meng-qi(梦琪), a staff of a record company who was once a fan of RTA, now of TFBOYS, said, TFBOYS was similar with RTA in many aspects, it even referenced RTA's experiences at first, but the Internet made TFBOYS famous.

In 2013, RTA disbanded, TFBOYS debuted.
In less than a year, TFBOYS became a popular teen group in China, its popularity and influence exceeded RTA at its climax.

③ Maximise the power of the web with a team of post-1990s

![Image](http://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz/nUuqEgZPj01gvFtSbuBiboiclySRFYZKF8KtNE75TribUbPicmw68KfK2gEZKRIxfyCnTjaHiaJX0xxxSSRGoOMftHg/640?wx_fmt=jpeg&wxfrom=5)

![Image](http://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz/nUuqEgZPj01gvFtSbuBiboiclySRFYZKF87O4DYPUzl78S6CmmncES7KE6o8DtkOODP36cMhicH8OibUBYRRftAe4Q/640?wx_fmt=jpeg&wxfrom=5)

__TFBOYS positions itself as exuberant and positive, Time Fengjun and Yinyuetai promotes TFBOYS in such a position as the principal line on the web.
While many members of the execution team are post-1990s.__

A person who knows the staff composition of Time Fengjun said,
__many people in Time Fengjun were born around 1990, these young persons are familiar with maximising the power of the web, and what the fans want to get__.
For example, when designing the gift box for Fan Club members, they added a "clapper" for using in live shows, an autograph album, and other commonly used items for fans.

This Internet style reflects in the operation of TFBOYS Official App and Weibo account.
Bertha is in charge of TFBOYS Official App, she had attended the operation of apps and Weibo accounts for fans.
She thought that, relatively speaking, there are more information on everyday life in the app and on the Weibo account.
She took such a case as an example:
When preparing for the entrance exam, WANG Jun-kai posted about his study and preparation of the exam on his Weibo account almost every day.
"Time Fengjun and Yinyuetai showed every aspect of TFBOYS via the Internet, this is a difficult task for traditional fan meetings."

During the preparation of the exam, WANG Jun-kai's Weibo post became a question bank, the frequently posted one and the interaction with fans on study brought him the title of "xue ba"(学霸, one who's score ranks top in class or school).
Compared with stars posting mainly about cuisine and cosmetics, this style made the promotion of TFBOYS much more different.

④ Steady core users with customised exclusive variety show

TFBOYS debuted in a special way, there's no conference or press release.
Time Fengjun only made a video clip named "Ten Years", published it on the web, which declared the birth of TFBOYS.

"Every step of TFBOYS has the trace of the Internet,
one of the most typical thing is, it made Internet variety show "TF Teens GO!"(TF少年GO！) two months after the debut." ZHANG Dou said.

"TF Teens GO!" is a weekly show lasts about 90 minutes with several fixed sections.
Talent agencies seldom make variety shows for their entertainers specially, but Time Fengjun did it, and made it a must for "Clovers" with well-designed contents.

"The tepid response in the beginning urged us to launch 'TF Teens GO!' and 'Study Room in Boys' School'."
A leader of Time Fengjun thought, the success of these two programmes is that they really attracted the fans.

⑤ Diversified Internet products take turns

You can find almost everything about TFBOYS on the web: videos, audio files, photos, cartoons, etc.
Time Fengjun attempted to diversify the products from the beginning.
After the release of the first E.P., Time Fengjun launched "TF Teens GO!" soon, and the short play "Study Room in Boys' School" followed up.

Before TFBOYS recorded "Yinyue Da Laibin"(音悦大来宾, literally: "Yinyue Guest") for Yinyuetai, the programme director studied every episode of "TF Teens GO!", found that the boys played almost all the games appeared in variety shows in China.
"I was shocked, their show was absolutely well-designed, the games were never played twice." The director said.

In ordinary days, new photos, videos, audio contents of TFBOYS appeared densely on the core platforms.
ZHANG Dou approved the method, __"Time Fengjun designed plenty of Internet programmes for TFBOYS, the fans can take just what they need."__

⑥ Label the products with typical styles

Many fans take "TF Teens GO!" as plain in quality, the episodes in the first season can be judged as "coarse".
But the show deeply attracted the fans of TFBOYS, because they could see the reality, it showed what boys aged around 15 may act before a camera.

Actually, one of the biggest trait of "TF Teens GO!" is, this is a programme without adults, emcees and participants are all members of TF Family,
the adults appeared in were in special costumes and masks.

TFBOYS is featured in cute and young.
Emcees of programmes about child stars are always adults, but "TF Teens GO!" is a programme without adults, its style is well-designed.

⑦ Intensify interaction with fans

"There are interactions with fans in 'TF Teens GO!', like asking the members with questions collected from the web."
Mei-mei is a fan of TFBOYS and a master degree candidate in radio and television programme director,
she had written a paper about "TF Teens GO!", thought that one of the biggest trait of the programme is highly interactive.

A typical example is, an episode arranged the discussion of calf love.
There was such a rumour about WANG Jun-kai at the time, the fans were cared about that.
Through the programme, WANG Jun-kai broke the rumour and shared his opinion about calf love.

As to the short play "Study Room in Boys' School", the stories and scripts were mostly derived from fans' comments, jokes, and concerns, which was a weekly indirect interaction with fans.

⑧ Focus on influential platforms and social media

Time Fengjun used Bilibili.com ingeniously, and it's now a focused platform for TFBOYS, nearly all sorts of related videos can be found here.
Bilibili.com is a camp of ACG, moe(萌え), otaku(オタク), and shipping culture in China, by virtue of the charming figures like heroes in comics, TFBOYS gained huge concern here.
"In the beginning, 'Study Room in Boys' School' appeared on the front page of Bilibili.com in the attempt of 'Clovers', it's a critical step in the development of TFBOYS."
A leader of Time Fengjun said.

Besides, Time Fengjun values social media much, like Weibo and WeChat.
If TFBOYS hadn't used Weibo in the early phase, it's impossible to imagine the following success.
Now, the agency are using WeChat, aims at young people.

⑨ Adjust products due to trends and user demands timely

There's an interesting detail -- when recording "Chongqing Discovery"(重庆发现) of Chongqing TV before 2013, the staff of Time Fengjun said, TFBOYS[the trainees, to be precise] wouldn't debut before being grown-ups.
With the escalating of the popularity of WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan on account of the cover videos, the agency re-evaluated its strategy.
Before long, in October 2013, WANG Jun-kai, WANG Yuan, and YI Yang-qian-xi formed TFBOYS and debuted.

To follow up, Time Fengjun constantly adjusted related products timely, the videos about TFBOYS were "evolving", it adjusted each product due to the change of the market and fans' demands.

A leader of Time Fengjun said, as early as 2011, the agency released many short programmes about the trainees, like "TF Family News"(TF家族新闻播报).
The show "TF Teens GO!" launched in late 2013 was in fact a continuation of and an improvement on the previous programme.
The preparation of the first episode of "TF Teens GO!" spent only one week, in later episodes, the agency constantly improved the contents based on the feedback from fans via the web.

However, Time Fengjun didn't intended to stay only on the Internet.
"The Internet gathered a lot of fans for TFBOYS, attending 'Happy Camp' of Hunan TV was also a boost to the popularity of the group.
In the future, we will choose some films which suit their age and can build up stage craft for TFBOYS." A leader of the agency said.

⑩ Break through the barrier between on-line and off-line promotion, organise targeted off-line events

By far, Yinyuetai cooperated with Time Fengjun in many aspects.
In June 2014, Yinyuetai set up the first Official Fan Club for TFBOYS, and bound the Fan Club to TFBOYS Official App.
Fans pay annual fees to be members of the Fan Club, and get privileges like exclusive videos, tickets of Yinyuetai's ceremony and TFBOYS' off-line events, and commodities about TFBOYS.

"Time Fengjun had organised many off-line events like fan meetings and signings, but those were not quite successful actually, it's common to be cancelled because of unanticipated huge number of attendees."
Daphne, who attended almost all the off-line events in Beijing from 2013, thought it's quite suitable for TFBOYS to interact with fans on the Internet, but many traditional off-line interactions were not.
Now, Time Fengjun is planning to set up an official fan organisation to make the off-line events more targeted.
The agency also consulted overseas experiences, was preparing for brand-new off-line contacts.

Targeted Internet skills brought a huge number of crazy fans.

### "As an elder sister, saving money for brother's marriage is perfectly justified!"

The star-making of Time Fengjun is successful in that it hit the demand of the current society.
In a sense, the Internet is just a proper bridge that brought TFBOYS to exactly those who need them.

In Ha-ni Xiao-xiong's fan club, there was once a "Clover" in college who spent 400 yuan per month on average to buy commodities about TFBOYS, this was half of her expenses.
Her dormitory was full of TFBOYS' posters, the dorm supervisor asked her to move them with penalty in grade and money, but she was never swayed.

This is a common state of "Clovers":
They like TFBOYS from the inner heart, it is even a deep affection hard to give up.
In Ha-ni Xiao-xiong's heart, TFBOYS are like his own younger brothers, in her spare time, she cares about what are the brothers doing, have they eat well, have they finished their homework...
As the only child of the family, Ha-ni Xiao-xiong always wanted to have a younger brother or sister, when seeing the photos the members of TFBOYS posted about the work or everyday life, she felt she's watching her own brothers growing.

Xiao-mian-li had mailed exercise books to the agency three times during WANG Jun-kai's preparing for the exam, many "Clovers" had done it at that time.
In WANG Jun-kai's words, these books cannot be finished within a whole life.
Xiao-mian-li were doing this because she saw the reflection of herself from this exam preparation.
Similar to WANG Jun-kai, Xiao-mian-li was once skilled in dancing, kept practising dancing after school study, she knew clearly the hardship of doing the both.

"TFBOYS wasn't popular through the Internet at once, there are many web celebrities, but TFBOYS are currently the only success in the Internet star-making."
LIU Shu-han(刘姝含), the head of Artist Development of Rock Records(China), said the success of TFBOYS is mainly the success of creating many concepts that satisfies certain demands of audience in China.

"Clover" Yu-meng is a "tanbi(耽美) manga" collector, she admitted that her concern about TFBOYS from 2013 was totally because the group satisfied her hobby in shipping.
However, ZHU Cui-min(朱翠敏), who had specially studied shipping culture, didn't agree with the statement that the initial success of TFBOYS was due to the implication of "Boy's Love".
"I've investigated thousands of so-called 'Hujioshi'(腐女子), the shipping culture in China is somewhat different with that in Japan, most Chinese 'Hujioshi' are just fond of charming males in a deeper level, which is not the view of male's love."

__ZHANG Dou thought TFBOYS was most attracting in their cuteness and purity, in the nature which children have, it can be summarised as "meng"(萌, means cute or adorable, derived from Japanese word "moe").__
When receiving an award at the second Yinyue V-Chart Ceremony, an emcee joked, "say thanks to the uncles and aunties."
Unexpectedly, TFBOYS did said "thank you, uncles and aunties" earnestly with a bow, the audience responded with a long laugh.

A cameraperson who had attended a shoot of TFBOYS said, during the shoot of swimming under the sea [synthesised effect], WANG Jun-kai fell asleep on the background plate.
"I felt they are really very cute, full of children's purity and nature, this may be the most attracting thing."

Ha-ni Xiao-xiong had surveyed 1,000 fans who lived around China in her fan club, under the question of "the first impression of TFBOYS", over 700 fans filled with the word "cute" or "meng".

(Data source: Yinyuetai TFBOYS Official Fan Club)

__A survey carried out by Tencent showed that 45% and 40% of TFBOYS' fans are post-2000s and post 1990s__.
Due to the data published by Sina, 77% of TFBOYS' fans are aged under 29.
"Students are the biggest source of TFBOYS' fans, while middle school students and college students are the main part of student fans.
These people are heavy Internet users and the core of moe, otaku, and shipping culture in China."
Jackie, who was once a director of publicity in a record company and did long-term study on the trend of Chinese pop culture, said that no matter how to define TFBOYS, it satisfied people's entertaining demand at least.

In Ha-ni Xiao-xiong's eyes, TFBOYS' attraction lies in the cultivation.
She took a "crazy Clover" in her fan club as an example, this "Clover" would save 500 yuan each month from early 2014 as *cotisation* for TFBOYS' member's marriages.
Ha-ni Xiao-xiong told her it's not necessary for them, but the "Clover" said angrily,
"As an elder sister, saving money for brother's marriage is perfectly justified!"

There's another "Clover" who has sharp eyes that she can correctly tell when the photo was taken with any photo of the members.
"Sometimes we joke that 'Clovers' must be good mothers, because we practised a lot." Ha-ni Xiao-xiong said.

Jackie said, there's a neglected issue about TFBOYS:
Many fans are larger than the three members, many of them are not married or have no child, these are the people who are willing to send gifts and greetings to encourage TFBOYS.
"In the one-child time, the children are quite lonely, this phenomenon is called 'empathy' in psychology that one can fill the loneliness with pretending having younger brothers or sons like TFBOYS."
She said, she initially knew TFBOYS because there were three girls who posted WANG Jun-kai's photo with the title "see my cute brother" in the same day in her Friend Circle, while in the same week, an elder girl posted WANG Yuan's photo and called him her son.
"This situation is the best earth for stars in cultivation mode."

###Three Gate Passes

Now, the fans can get the latest news of TFBOYS from related apps and Weibo accounts, this makes TFBOYS leading roles in a cultivation sand-play:
the fans get the star's actions from the Internet at any time, and react off-line.

Fans have prepaid in a café near WANG Jun-kai's school for him to have dinner.
The places TFBOYS live and study in are very familiar to "Clovers", most "Clovers" who tripped to Chongqing would list WANG Yuan's and WANG Jun-kai's schools as a must.

People compare TFBOYS with AKB48 in Japan in cultivation mode.
The hottest girl group made completely by Akimoto Yasushi(秋元康)(Japanese scriptwriter, lyricist, writer, and director), aimed at "idols at your side" ["idols you can meet face-to-face"], the members perform in exclusive theatres nearly every day.
The fans participated in the cultivation process through websites and other channels.
And there exists an annual General Election.

"TF Family initially intended to imitate AKB48, but TFBOYS is like Korean groups more and more after its debut."
LIU Shu-han said, the key point of AKB48 is not only cultivation, but "meet face-to-face" and "to the ground".
"You can see AKB48 in nearly any day at the theatres, but you can hardly see TFBOYS."

LIU Shu-han said, the cultivation mode of TFBOYS are probably more suitable for Chinese market, the game rules like General Election is quite unacceptable in China, because the "cruel" competition violates the mild and mean doctrines of Chinese people.
"You can see photos of TFBOYS writing homework, you can see their growth in height and through each song, that's enough.
If TFBOYS introduced something like General Election, it may probably not be popular."

To cultivated stars, the connection with fans in affection is utterly important.
__In a sense, TFBOYS is a healing product made in China, it's similar to the value of healing novels, anime, and films to otaku in Japan.__
Japanese otaku culture is essentially a pursuit of the idea of healing, the dreams unable to realise become illusions in films, novels, and anime, the product heals the person when he/she is experiencing it.

To TFBOYS, their healing power comes from the positive image they created themselves.
In the interview at the backstage of the third Yinyue V-Chart Ceremony, when being asked why are there so many people like you, WANG Yuan said, "maybe it's because of we are fighting, have positive energy."

ZHANG Dou was impressed by a detail, TFBOYS took their homework to the ceremonies.
When they came in 2014, as they were not very famous and the activities were not too much, the members did their homework at the waiting room.
When they came in 2015, as the workload was heavy, they left the homework at the hotel, and did it after the ceremony ended.

ZHANG said, one reason of TFBOYS' rise is the concept of positive and exuberant on them.
From 2009, Time Fengjun paid much attention on the school study of the trainees, YI Yang-qian-xi had ranked the top in his school, WANG Jun-kai's and WANG Yuan's schools are both key schools of Chongqing.
Such an identity brought TFBOYS larger influence and growth potential among peers.

"Parents won't let their children like a star with bad school score or image."
Jackie said, "'meng' and cute, the cultivation mode, and the identity of good boys" are the three gate passes that made TFBOYS develop rapidly on the Internet Express.

"The position of the group was very clear since they were trainees -- young, exuberant, and positive."
Time Fengjun told us, the members of TFBOYS are very young, there are many constraints in the positioning.
For now, at the age around 15, "active" and "positive" are the most suitable position.

Due to the approval of such labels on TFBOYS, Mengniu Yoghurt(蒙牛酸酸乳) cooperated with TFBOYS last year.
ZHAO Xing-ji(赵兴继), the general manager of Mengniu nutrition brand centre, said, "Mengniu performed detailed market survey in the first phase, because we want the brand to be younger.
The result showed that the most popular stars for post-1990s are TFBOYS and EXO."
To be prudent, Mengniu carried out a survey in show biz, TFBOYS received much public praise,
"they are young, exuberant, and positive, and are very suitable for our product."

### Make a Duplicated TFBOYS?

In the views from Time Fengjun, the development of TFBOYS was contingent, there was no successful experiences in China before, and it would be difficult to duplicate an idol group following the same path.
But the leader admitted that the success of TFBOYS proved that the type of teen idols is now in Chinese market.

Compared to the prudence, ZHANG Dou was optimistic at the mode, he believed that with the subversion of the Internet to entertainment, the mode of TFBOYS is duplicable.
"It may be difficult to have another popular TFBOYS, but their success can be referenced."

ZHANG Dou thought, it's difficult because TFBOYS caught up with the golden time.
"They are the first popular group made by the Internet, TFBOYS maximised the power of it.
They gained unprecedented concern because they are the first, it's hard for later ones to gain concern in such a scale."

Yinyuetai is now duplicating the mode, a project named "Yinyue Stage"(音悦Stage) has been started out,
freshmen can gather his/her own fans with MVs and other methods via Yinyuetai, the selected ones will finally join talent agencies, expand their influence with Yinyuetai's following projects.

"Firstly, we will do what TFBOYS did before 2014."
SHI Ying(时颖), the leader of the project, said, it's undeniable that TFBOYS is popular with some luck, but it verified the coming of Internet stars and the reshaping of the entire fan economy.

Now, ZHANG Dou's Yinyuetai takes TFBOYS as a success model, they even found the developing target of Yinyuetai from TFBOYS:
Be a platform that links fans with stars, like a new Taobao in music entertainment industry.

"Each fan is a 'C', each star is a 'B', Yinyuetai could be a C2B platform in music industry." ZHANG said.

In ZHANG's opinion, TFBOYS is essentially not a music group solely, but an idol group.
"__An idol, is selling the person, not the music.__
There are many idol groups in Korea, the singing or dancing of each single member may not be the best, but his/her popularity may be much higher than mature and professional singers."
ZHANG took "the person" the most important keyword in TFBOYS' success.
In his opinion, if there's no concept like purity, exuberance, or "zheng tai"(正太, means cute pre-adolescent boys, derived from Japanese word "shota", but differs from its English meanings), TFBOYS won't be very popular.
__"There's not too much business purely around music, but many imaginations around the person."__

In ZHANG's office, there were over ten gift boxes of TFBOYS Fan Club, it's the first commodity Yinyuetai designed about TFBOYS.
In the box priced 258 yuan, there's a member card, a rigid fan, three brochures about the stars, and some fan products.
When it's on sell, too many fans rushed in with a huge amount of money at once, the payment gateway of Yinyuetai was blocked by Alipay.
"This is the current situation of fan economy in the time of selling the person." ZHANG said.

To realise such crazy actions, the concept of fans should be changed.
A detail that moved many "Clovers" is, every time TFBOYS met fans, they would bow low to the fans before leaving, while many elder entertainers didn't have such behaviour.
Time Fengjun paid much attention to the interaction with fans from the very beginning.
The agency said that the first planned interaction was in the third or fourth episode of "TF Teens GO!" Season 1, the boys called some fans who bought the commodities to express thanks.

Hoyamatsu Yasuhito said, from now on, standing high above fans to guide them is hard, to bow to and serve fans is the trend.
He shared a case that Japanese talent agencies make at least four surveys per year to collect detailed data on fans' demands and favourites.
"We must know what fans need first, then make targeted products."

Hoyamatsu said, he asks the entertainers to use social networks like Line and Facebook, to interact with fans more frequently.
"Stars can't be looked up to, they should comply with fans' demands."

In this respect, TFBOYS did well. At present, the number of fans they gathered is among the top of Chinese stars.
In either Baidu Search Index and the number of Weibo reposts, TFBOYS ranks among the top of Chinese stars, QQ Groups related to it even exceeded super star Andy Lau(刘德华).

### Hidden Troubles Behind

Not all the people are obssessed with Internet stars.
FENG Jue(冯珏), CEO of Warner Bros. Records (China), said, the power of traditional TV Stations cannot be neglected.
The Internet may brought a huge amount of fans, but to push the star to a higher level, the power of fans needs a tipping point.

He took singer LI Rong-hao(李荣浩) as an example.
"The success of LI Rong-hao came from his Golden Melody Award and the attendance in the programme 'I'm a Singer'(我是歌手).
He gained many fans through his music before that, but the award and the TV programme released the power of those fans."

Bigger query pointed to the sustainable of TFBOYS.
Justine Bieber experienced similarly at first, but later made many mistakes, which impacted his fame very much due to the stardom and the environment of show biz.
If such fault appeared on TFBOYS, it would be lethal.

Even if the behaviour's not considered, the identities of "group" and "teen idols" make the future of TFBOYS uncertain.

Many insiders compare TFBOYS with the once famous "Xiao Hu Dui"(小虎队, The Little Tigers).
The group of Nicky Wu(吴奇隆), Julian Chen(陈志朋), and Alec Su(苏有朋) was the fastest developing group in Asia from their debut in 1988.
The average age was just 16.6 at the debut. In 1989, its album "Xiaoyao You"(逍遥游) was the annual best-selling album in Asia.
But only two years later, Julian Chen served in the army, which made the group temporarily disbanded.
Though it recombined in 1993, the serving of Nicky Wu in 1997 led to the final disbandment.

This is the biggest problem many idol groups encounters: unstable personnel, and the following risk to the talent agency.
To EXO as an example, in October 2014, the news of LU Han(鹿晗)'s contract proceeding led to 9.7% loss of the share price of S.M. Entertainment.

Further, teen idol is initially a much cautious choice.
Not just in the risk of change in voice and looks, but also the huge change in values.
Take SUN Jia-xing(孙佳星) as an example, in the 1980s, the 11-year-old SUN was famous by singing songs like "Hua Xianzi"(花仙子, literally: "The Flower Child") and "Zhong Taiyang"(种太阳, literally: "Sowing Suns").
But at around 15, she suddenly decided not to sing, because she thought the life under limelight cannot coexist with stable family life, and finally faded out from the mainstream's sight.

Ha-ni Xiao-xiong said, she was always entangled, in one hand, she would like to see TFBOYS always on stage, and become world-class super stars one day;
in the other hand, she was very worried that the show biz as a dying vat would dye the fighting and exuberant boys with other colours.
"If they are really my brother, I may tell them to quit without hesitation."

Maybe the most possible risk comes from the members themselves.
In the voice-changing, with the fame booming, they are also facing the routine troubles in show biz like gossip, rumours, and possible fiercer competition.
The Internet which made them accomplished started to take in troubles, there was rumours of calf love and roaring at fans about WANG Jun-kai, though been verified as fake news, there WERE stars been knocked down by rumours.

It's worth noting that, compared to singing stars, when gaining larger concern, idol stars are much easier to be abandoned by fans.
A truth is, many fans of TFBOYS were once fans of RTA.

Luckily, TFBOYS' fans expressed faith to their idol.
From the debut, "Clovers" have a slogan: Accompany in ten years.
The greater news is, many shrewd merchants now know the value of TFBOYS, at least film studios were unable to contain any longer,
"The Great Wall"(长城) directed by ZHANG Yi-mou and "Jue Ji"(爵迹) directed by GUO Jing-ming announced the joining of WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan respectively.

These experiences will harden them, and be an important turning point in the following progress in performing and development in commerce.
At least to the three members, joining some famous films itself is the insurance of the career.
