TFBOYS debuted in the summer of 2013, the name is the abbreviation of "The Fighting Boys", which is full of positive energy.
The members are three boys in junior middle schools -- WANG Jun-kai, WANG Yuan, and YI Yang-qian-xi.
TFBOYS is totally "made in China", its agency sits in Chongqing.
In early 2012, WANG Jun-kai started to release singing covers like "Qiu Niao"(囚鸟, literally: "A Bird In Cage") and "Wo Yao Kuaile"(我要快乐, literally: "I Want Happiness"), among which the cover of "Wode Gesheng Li"(我的歌声里, literally: "In My Song") was greatly reposted.
Soon after, WANG Yuan joined TF Family, his cover of "Yige Xiang Xiatian, Yige Xiang Qiutian"(一个像夏天，一个像秋天, literally: "One Likes Summer, One Likes Autumn") with WANG Jun-kai was reposted over 80,000 times including the original singer Christine Fan(范玮琪), got over 5 million hits.
The cover of "Yangcong"(洋葱, onion) in June 2013 had been reposted by Ashin(阿信) of Mayday, and got over 30 million hits, became the hottest topic on Weibo at the time.

**A Visit to Schools**

## Fan Works in Café to "Take Care of" WANG Jun-kai

WANG Jun-kai is in Shu Ren Secondary School of Chongqing No.8 Secondary School, some female students told us, "WANG Jun-kai is mild, low-key, but not tedious."
He seemed shy and bashful, spoke in a low voice that one had to be closer to get it.
Maybe it's because of the camera, WANG Jun-kai sometimes fiddled with his hair slightly.
His head teacher Ms. YIN told us, "WANG Jun-kai is just an ordinary student in the class, his classmates treat him commonly.
He ranks above the average in scores, got about 640 in the second model exam of the Senior Middle School Entrance Examination, in which his Chemistry was well-done, English advanced a lot, Maths was under improvement."
It is said that WANG Jun-kai will be recommended for admission to the senior school of Shu Ren with art talent [unconfirmed].
WANG Yuan is in Chongqing Nankai Middle School, most students know him, and know that he likes basketball very much.

In their classmates' view, WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan have nothing special.
But in the fans', the cafés and tea shops they frequently visit are interesting places.
When our reporter was getting out of the school, some fans were eagerly staring into the yard.
Xiao Rou(pseudonym), who is about to graduate from senior middle school, liked WANG Jun-kai for years,
"Karry(WANG Jun-kai) liked this beef noodle café before, but likes the nearby rice noodle café now."
The keeper of the beef noodle café told us that he had posted a back view of WANG Jun-kai eating at his café on Weibo, which was reposted over 3,000 times, many fans outside Chongqing came here after that.

To make WANG Jun-kai eat well, the fan even worked in the rice noodle café for free.
"I serve guests or wash dishes, about one hour per day."
Xiao Rou never wash dishes at home, but does all this because of WANG Jun-kai.

**The popularity of TFBOYS can be revealed from data.**

There are over 100 million results about "TFBOYS" on Baidu, compared to 74.4 million about Korean star "Kim Soo Hyun"(김수현, 金秀贤), 85.4 million about Korean group "BIGBANG".
A music video of TFBOYS got over 20 million hits... Its popularity exceeds Korean stars.

On 10th May, WANG Jun-kai posted about his homework on Weibo, with complaints about the stress before the exam.
This post was reposted 270,000 times, and got 280,000 comments.
It's not much compared to his over 2.26 million followers on Weibo.
But to YAO Chen(姚晨), "the queen on Weibo" who has over 69.55 million followers, most of her Weibo posts has just thousands of reposts and comments.

These data surprised many people, these facts are stronger than any argument.

However, they are mysterious.

Others are trying every means to become popular, but they don't.
They are popular, their popularity exceeds many super stars.
But they remain low-key, unwilling to face media.
Their agency and the members of the group seldom received interviews before, which made them more mysterious.

After long-time communication, we became the first media coming close to this unusual idol group, made a visit to their agency,
to uncover the secret of its mysterious popularity, to answer "who are they", "what's behind them", "why do they attract", "how did they get popular", and "is it a hype".
Through the discovery, we wish to bring a deep thinking to the fickle entertainment market in China:
How should we cultivate idols? What idols do we need?

**Talk with Member**

## Go Straight to the End, Never Give Up

As idols gaining such concern in less than a year, how did the members think about it?
One day before his last Children's Day, WANG Yuan was recording a programme in the agency.
He greeted our reporter politely.
That was the figure of a boy, with a sweet smile, nice features, and pointed chin -- an under-14-year-old boy with a clear-cut silhouette.
After the interview, he stood up and bowed, said "thank you" before leaving.

**Joy of Being Famous**

### Being Shy When Talking Popularity

WANG Yuan wanted to play happily with friends on the last Children's Day.
"When I entered my junior middle school, I get along very well with my classmates.
We are somewhat more popular these days, but they don't treat the identity of a 'star' much, we are still good friends."
When the word "popular" spoke out by WANG Yuan, our reporter smiled, which made WANG Yuan a little shy.
He said that his school mates don't treat him as a star, never asked for taking a photo, sometimes just asked for a signed photo for their friends.

Now he scores among the average in class.
"I was not adapted to the courses when entering junior middle school, the scores were worse, but now I'm progressing rapidly.
Anyhow, school study cannot be lagged behind."
Facing the popularity, WANG Yuan's attitude was more mature than his age.
"Maybe people are feeling refreshed at our cute, optimistic, and lively."
As mentioned "refresh", to the worry of being forgotten some days, he said,
"I've thought of it, but I'm training continuously, to improve my strengths, in order to maintain the popularity."
All the members have their strengths, "Karry sings and dances well, is good at leadership, Jackson dances the best among us."
WANG Yuan said he is the most talkative one, like a spokesman.
"Besides singing, I can be a good M.C., I hosted all the shows in school.
I want to be an excellent emcee like HE Jiong(何炅)."

**Troubles beyond Fame**

### Fans too Enthusiastic, Unaccustomed to Interviews

The fans' crazy pursuit is troublesome.
"Some fans would enter the classroom after class or school, that's embarrassing to both classmates and teachers."
His home nears the school, he walks home every day,
"some fans keep following, say no words, take no photos, I don't know how to deal with it."

Our reporter found that WANG Yuan had his hands crossed and tightly held during the interview, which showed that he's nervous and shackled.
WANG Yuan said he's unaccustomed to a face-to-face interview, "our manager teaches us etiquette, and not to answer some questions, like embarrassing ones and those related to our families.
I'll be embarrassed to the questions about my parents, I don't want to bother my family."

After choosing this path, WANG Yuan said firmly that he will go straight to the end, keep striving on, and never give up.
"I want to be an excellent entertainer.
My targets are JJ Lin(林俊杰) and G.E.M.(Gloria Tang Tsz-Kei, 邓紫棋)."

**Talk with Agency**

## Learns from Japanese & Korean Agencies, Runs through New Media

To be frank, there are many boys cute as TFBOYS, and there are similar groups.
But why did they become popular, and get more popular?
It's easy to think of hyper, those popular ones on the web are mostly related to hype.
We were very curious about the "hyper" of TFBOYS, Time Fengjun in Chongqing, we had many questions about its running and promotion.
Ms. REN, the manager of TFBOYS, accepted our interview.

**Q:**
Why did you create TFBOYS?  
**A:**
The entertainment market in China was lack of the concept of "trainees" while there are many in Japanese and Korean.
We see it as a potential market, and learn from Japanese and Korean training mode, we are not simply copying them.
The project started in 1999, and the agency was found then.

**Q:**
What are the requirements of the trainees?  
**A:**
We choose from boys under 12, the recruiting department find them from schools.
After three-month probation, many of them will leave.
The trainees in Japanese and Korean have to get training every day, despite of school study.
But we can't in China, so our primary condition is the study score of the boy, in order not to influence their study.
WANG Jun-kai is one of the earliest trainees, only he remained till now.
The boys we select are supported by their parents, poured great efforts by themselves, and are talented.

**Q:**
Do you sign contracts with the trainees?  
**A:**
We are in contractual relationships, but they are not treated as commercial products, the trilateral of us, the parents, and the trainees are confidential.
(**Q:** Are they paid?)
There is a payment relationship, but the children and their parents don't pay much attention to it.

**Q:**
Is the great popularity of TFBOYS in your expectation?  
**A:**
It's in our foresight, but a little earlier.
We expected it in three years, but now less than a year.
Even in other cases, this result is also in our expectation, only maybe some months later.
We know clearly that they need improvements, but we are happy with the welcome of the market at present.  
New media is a channel of our promotion.
In fact, WANG Jun-kai had works released in 2010, 2011, and 2012.
We are not popular abruptly, and we don't intend to.
They gained some popularity through the cover of "Yige Xiang Xiatian, Yige Xiang Qiutian" in 2011, and some through the cover of "Yangcong" last year, this prompted us to create a group.
WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan was not good enough at dancing, so we found YI Yang-qian-xi to make the group -- both singing and dancing are necessary.
We have our plan, we did this after preparation.

**Q:**
But the fame comes and goes, especially via the web. Do you worry about this?  
**A:**
We are very clear that "fame is a bubble", so do the boys themselves.
Many idols from talent shows were popular at the time, but were quickly forgotten after a year or two.
Our boys are well-prepared about this.
We would run in our plan, retain the fans with better music works.
The fans will follow up after they get more strengths, be accepted by more people.
We all have usual minds on popularity.

**Q:**
Many people are doubting that you are hyping through paid mercenaries.  
**A:**
We don't need to pay, the fans are our mercenaries, for free. Haha.
I can guarantee that we did nothing on the followers and reposts of their Weibo accounts.
We need analysis, adulterated data is of no use.
WANG Jun-kai had expressed his opposition of zombie fans with a post saying,
"someone's taking zombies to follow me from last night. I've removed them. Would you please don't do that again?
Or, I have to remove them tonight."
This is not pretended, we don't hype up these matters.

**Q:**
SHANG Wen-jie(尚雯婕) had said TFBOYS are not real "entertainers", it has no personality and works.  
**A:**
We are preparing for new music works and album, with not much activities.
They are not standard entertainers at present, but it does have some works.
We released two E.P.s created with Korean musicians, received good responses.
Of course, it is not easy to have echoing works.
They are students in the first place, not entertainers.
We don't want to append too much idolized image and mechanised patterns, being natural is better, which is also its personality.
We see more value after they grow up, don't want them to be too commercialised at present.

**Q:**
So you refuse commercial performances?  
**A:**
We refuse too commercialised activities, only accept those that promote them or suit their images.
There was little commercial performances.
We won't consume their popularity excessively, just face it with usual mind.

**Q:**
Is there any problem in the managing?  
**A:**
I'm the manager, it's more tired than managing adult ones.
There are many things they don't know, but even children have to be presentable anyhow.
I'm very nervous in every activities and recordings, with beating heart and sweaty palms.
I'm under great stress every time.  
Actually, we don't want them to be much exposed.
This interview is the first one we received in depth with media face-to-face, others before were through phones.
We wish to protect them well, make the mysterious last longer.

**Voices from Music Industry**

## An Inevitable Accident

SI Jie(司捷), so-called "Godfather of Music Groups", had made groups such as 1st-gen "Qingchun Mei Shaonü"(青春美少女), "Top Combine"(至上励合), "iMe", and "TimeZ".
In our interview, SI stated the popularity of TFBOYS as an inevitable accident.
"It's inevitable because the market of music groups is large, it's an accident because they are very young in age."
In his opinion, TFBOYS fills in the gap of the market at that age, which is an important reason.

Meanwhile, SI pointed out that the works of TFBOYS do not meet the commercial factors, the group is still raw, not professional, and it hasn't entered the show biz completely.
"I find someone of them has great potential.
But if I'm their manager, I will let them develop with different characters.
They are cute boys showing natural states. However, to become professional entertainers, they should have distinct characters, recognisable voices, and suitable executions."

Will the mode of TFBOYS' popularity be the new mode in making stars?
SI thought it difficult to predict.
"This mode is good in filling in a gap. But if others try to copy it, operate on the same age, will they succeed?
That depends, just like there is only one Michael Jackson."
It's okay to learn this mode, as to the result of the practice, many endeavours should be made.
"The agency should be more professional, in order not to make the group only a flash."

**Postscript**

## Three Boys Make Chinese Show Biz Unprepared

> Written by REN Hong-wei

I thought it a difficult task before the interview, the one with a popular boy, but also a student under fourteen.
To make him feel relaxed, I started the conversation with the topic of Children's Day.
I intended to talk in Chongqing dialect to build a easy atmosphere, but WANG Yuan said in mandarin,
"it's better to use mandarin, I'm used to it."
Though his accent was not very standard, his attitude was earnest, like an entertainer.

But he's not completely an entertainer, he's not sophisticated, had his hands crossed and tightly held when nervous.
He would seek help from the manager when the question was difficult for him.
Except extremely narcissistic entertainers, the words like "I'm becoming more and more charming" may only be heard from a child.

We communicated with the agency for a long time before this interview,
they didn't want the boys to be totally exposed in the limelight, and there were not many commodities, which is an effective commercial opportunity for many agencies.
Maybe they know the quintessence of "hunger marketing", the more mysterious it is, the more curious the mass will be.
Anyhow, their practice may provide a relatively healthy path for the boys' growth.

To such celebrities on the web or from talent shows, the convention in Chinese show biz is to push them to the market at once, make the profit maximized in the shortest time.
As their works and strengths in music, that's a later story.
I agree with the manager's judgement that "fame is a bubble", it comes and goes.
It is obvious that this infamous agency does better than many large ones on this point.
At the least, it doesn't make the group commercialised, doesn't push the group undressed.
To a certain extent, it protects its entertainers, especially when they are children. This is very important.

Protection is the basic, how to maintain their competitiveness is more important.
Just like SHANG's comment, an entertainer should have personality and good works.
They are learning from Japanese and Korean mode, but I wish they could also learn from Justine Bieber (before becoming a bad guy of course)
-- study from Usher, dig into singing and dancing, announce to the world with that well-known "Baby".

At present, or in a very long time, TFBOYS need a good music work, to become real entertainers then.
However, their appearance was like a flash, made the Chinese show biz totally unprepared.
