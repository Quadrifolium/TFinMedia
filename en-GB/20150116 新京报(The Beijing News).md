As a group making 1970s and 1980s anxious about being out of fashion, the rise of TFBOYS is very Internet-like, while the phenomenon is very unique.
Our journalist interviewed the members of TFBOYS, the boss of the agency, and their manager, to uncover this unique phenomenon as well as doubts in lip-synch, overdosed fans, and doing the wrong duty.

Fans spent heavily on edifice ad to celebrate WANG Jun-kai's birthday.

## What TFBOYS said

CHEN He(陈赫), who is very popular due to the variety shows and films recently, were "frustrated" these days.
When he walk out from the airport, hundreds of fans who came were to welcome TFBOYS.
He posted on Weibo with a picture of his lonely silhouette to scoff himself, "at the airport, there's TFBOYS, and a 'has-been' comedian."

Not only CHEN He, the Internet in 2014 changed upside down, youths like LU Han(鹿晗), Kris Wu(吴亦凡), G-Dragon, Victoria Song(宋茜), idols like LI Yi-feng(李易峰), William Chen(陈伟霆), LIN Geng-xin(林更新), Internet sensations like "Jiao Shou Yi Xiao Xing"(叫兽易小星), the team of "One Hundred Thousand Bad Jokes"(十万个冷笑话), all agitated the rank of the whole show biz.
Xiao Cao, a senior fan, told us, "TFBOYS is powerful in attracting fans, they gained many from group fans, anime fans, teen fans, and many other fans."

As a group making 1970s and 1980s anxious about being out of fashion, the rise of TFBOYS is very Internet-like, while the phenomenon is very unique.
Our journalist interviewed the members of TFBOYS, the boss of the agency, and their manager, to uncover this unique phenomenon as well as doubts in lip-synch, overdosed fans, and doing the wrong duty.

**Pros**
### Polite, Good-looking, Fine Image Maintaining

We had interviewed TFBOYS in May 2014, in the state of curious and observing the market, without much personal impression.
Such feeling changed in the second half of the year.
Xia-tian(fake name), both a director of iQiyi and a fan of TFBOYS, said, in a recording in Beijing, as there were too many people there and fans who bought scalped tickets cannot get in,
"their manager was crying outside, and TFBOYS apologised at the entrance."

MAO Jia(毛嘉), the executive director of "Generation Show"(年代秀), who made the episode with TFBOYS, turned to be a fan,
"They are well-trained, they have a fascination on stage, it makes you filled with hope.
And they are young, everything is possible for them."

To make aunties and sisters be attracted, only politeness and kindness is not enough.
To Xia-tian, they are not just vigorous and charming, but also pure like a piece of paper in many aspects,
and "the special voice between a child and a youth, which other group has it?
Seeing the canine teeth of WANG Jun-kai and the pouting mouth of WANG Yuan, which girl can control herself?"

Because the exact right time flies, similar stars easily fall into the money-gaining commercial performances.
According to tvN of Korea, Kim Soohyun(金秀贤, 김수현) gained nearly a hundred billion KRW(580 million RMB), who tops the Korean chart. However, TFBOYS doesn't accept commercial performances.
It's known to us that due to the reason of their school study, the group didn't attend any commercial performance of real estates or shopping malls, but TV programmes like "Shaonian Zhongguo Qiang"(少年中国强, literally: "Powerful Chinese Youths") and "Kaixue Di Yi Ke"(开学第一课, literally: "The First Lesson of the Semester").
The manager Yuna said, "We don't accept too commercialised things, such performances at present would lower their commercial value.
It's said that agencies like S.M. gain profit in two years, but we have insisted five years, we don't mind to keep it longer.
We planned to consider it in three or four years."

**Cons**
### Lip-synch, Doing Wrong Duty, and Overdosed Fans

Popularity leads to disputes.
From their attendance in the Mid-Autumn Festival Gala of Hunan TV, a music critic on the web kept his eyes on the lip-synch issue of EXO and TFBOYS, blasted at TFBOYS many times on Weibo, and had posted a phone-call recording with the manager Yuna, which caused much dispute.
Yuna didn't respond to this matter after a whole day's work, but told our journalist, "boys at fourteen and fifteen are changing voices, and their voice conditions are very unstable.
Frequent using of throat may cause permanent injury.
We have paused their vocal lessons recently, will choose songs with proper vocal range for the new album.
We hope people can understand and be considerate."

There are different opinions on the lip-synch issue of TFBOYS, commenter Hen-hen-hong thought that "the lip-synch matter in the performances of Korean groups are common and deserved.
We should re-comprehend what an 'entertainer' is -- for TFBOYS's fans, their focus on the three 'zheng tai'(正太, means cute pre-adolescent boys, derived from Japanese word "shota", but differs from its English meanings) is never 'endowed with both looks and voices'.
To be practical, breath steadily during strenuous dancing is very critical.
In the demand of fans, new hair-style and costume of the idol is more important than the voice.
And to others, their sensation is much greater than being an idol."

But to those conserved parents, the counteractive effect of TFBOYS may be "doing the wrong duty" and the worry of "the blind pursuing of being entertainers and unwilling to study".
Such thought started as early as when "Xiao Hu Dui"(小虎队, Little Tigers) appeared, overcast Chinese teenagers till now.
Time Fengjun kept "performing well in school study" a prerequisite in recruiting trainees, and are maintaining the image that "YI Yang-qian-xi is a 'xue ba'(学霸, one who's score ranks top in class or school), WANG Yuan and WANG Jun-kai are good at study".
Therefore, Xia-tian and many other fans told our journalist firmly, "'Xue ba' Karry always takes his 'Tianli 38 Sets'(天利38套, a guidance book series for entrance examinations), 'xue shen'(学神, a state exceeds "xue ba") 'Qian Zong'(千总, literally: "Boss Qian") usually sleeps after eleven after dancing and doing homework."

TFBOYS's fans are acting very crazy.
For example, in order to make related Weibo topics hotter, they keep commenting and reposting, even chatting in the reposts;
to promote the rank on music charts, they keep replaying the MV all day long.
These are what fans of Eason Chan(陈奕迅) or Jay Chou(周杰伦) won't make.
But it's exactly such enthusiasm that made CHEN He "envious", that occupied some coser's admission opportunity of a comic show[confirmed rumour].
It's exactly such enthusiasm that made fans fulfilled, like what Xia-tian said, "I can tell that we are guarding them."

**Marketing Skills**
## Cultivation + Internet + Idols Echelon

Viewing from the entertainment industry, TFBOYS follows the trainee mode of Johnny & Associates of Japan, which recruits boys aged ten to fourteen, packs some into a group after several years' training.
The trainees may get certain exposure in being dancing partners for the debuted, or attending small shows.

But it's obvious that the agency of TFBOYS has no strength as Johnny's or S.M. of Korea, hence it adopted a more pleased cultivation mode that makes fans feel their growing from children to teens,
which is like a public cultivating project, which makes fans pour in affection, gains profit when they are still trainees.

The competitors of TFBOYS are "the F4 of 2000s'" of EE-Media(天娱传媒) and "the trainees of Boss SHANG" of SHANG Wen-jie(尚雯婕).
Compared to them, Time Fengjun has the least resources in show biz.
But as a pioneer, TFBOYS didn't follow the traditional routine with press release and debut album, but sought a way out in Internet thought.
In early days, it kept interacting with fans on the web every day.
It changes elements of the self-made variety show when fans give advices.
From covering videos and self-made short plays to being popular nowadays, the fans witnessed their changes.
In such a process, one may be involved in events such as their doing homework, or attending exams, which has never been experienced before.
All these things are hidden treasures, ensures the delight of discovery in the future.

At the same time, like all other agencies, Time Fengjun are planning on other teams.
According to Yuna, it is forging TF Band which "will debut in some years".
The much slower pace is due to the consideration of being more complete than TFBOYS,
"if the completion of TFBOYS at debut was, say, forty to fifty percent, I hope TF Band to be sixty percent."

## Conversation

**We Are Sometimes Frustrated at Some Fans' Actions**

On 6th Aug., 2013, TFBOYS debuted. There's no conference, no press release, a 3'49'' video clip named "Ten Years"(十年) was all they gave out.
Looking through their videos before debut, YI Yang-qian-xi was once a member of "Fei Xuan Shaonian"(飞炫少年), had performed on CCTV and Satellite TV Channels, but drowned out in various child stars.
WANG Jun-kai had even been pointed out of being out of tune when he attended "Up! Juniors"(向上吧！少年) of Hunan TV in 2012, and left the stage in shyness.
When talking about entering the agency, WANG Yuan said casually,
"it's for free, for such a good thing, I must come."
Three different experiences also reflected their distinct characters.

Let's see how they think about their popularity.

**Reporter's Notes**
## What will be in ten years?

No matter appreciate or sneer at TFBOYS, you should admit that they are indeed very popular.
Take the data as a proof: up to now, the average search index of the keyword "TFBOYS" on Baidu was 133,327 in the past half year, which was three times of "ZHOU Jie-lun"(Jay Chou, 周杰伦), or a little lower than "YANG Mi"(杨幂), while the keyword didn't appear one and a half years ago.
According to the report of Qzone, the influence rate of TFBOYS in 2000s have exceeded EXO, this is one of the few Chinese idol groups that can contend with Korean ones.

At the same time, as the mainstay of the era, with the mainstream voice been transferred to the 1970s and 1980s,
the sensations like Jay Chou and "Xiao Hu Dui" become eternal icons and memories of the time, though they had been criticized or condemned by the mainstream voice at that time.
To imagine scene ten years later, how will the 1990s and 2000s treat the idol TFBOYS?

"Even if failed in ten years, we will be closer to the dream."
When saying these words, WANG Jun-kai was fourteen, WANG Yuan and YI Yang-qian-xi were thirteen.
