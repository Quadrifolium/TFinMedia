"Do not mention the past, the life is full of trials and hardships."
Recently on video sites like Youku and 56.com, "Dang Ai Yi Cheng Wangshi"(当爱已成往事, literally: "When Love Becomes the Past") covered by two boys were reposted by many, the video got over 400,000 views, made it the most concerned covering during the commemoration of Leslie Cheung(张国荣).

The two boys had been remembered by many people in days.
They are 13-year-old WANG Jun-kai from the 8th Middle School and 12-year-old WANG Yuan from Dajiang Primary School of Chongqing.
In the MV, their tacit cooperation perfectly reproduced the classic work with affectionate performance.
Especially the alternation of the suicide scene of CHENG Die-yi(程蝶衣, a leading role in the film "Farewell My Concubine"), who was acted by Leslie.

When a journalist once asked how they comprehended the emotions of the song, WANG Yuan said frankly that he "pretended" -- imitated the original, pretended to be understood.
While WANG Jun-kai said he was just singing in sorrow and sadness, with his experience of farewell with classmates in primary school.

The MV drew many Leslie's fans' concern.
A netizen called "liulin338" said, "they are too young to show the distress!"
While "Tian Jiang Da Ren" of 56.com commented, "Eileen Chang(张爱玲) is correct at saying 'better to be known as early as possible'!
Korean stars debut at 16, training earlier can make the basic solid, can be popular around Asia."

No matter they sang well or it's a hype, the MV was indeed popular.

Netizens even called them "cutest zheng tai"(正太, means cute pre-adolescent boys, derived from Japanese word "shota", but differs from its English meanings).
Their Weibo account have tens of thousands of followers, they had been invited by TV programmes, and some celebrities had reposted their coverings.
They are like rising child stars.

Actually, WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan's popular is not a coincidence.
When searching their names on video sites, you'd find many videos, each of which had over ten thousand hits, tagged with "TF Family".
And their singing skills, performances, and costumes were obviously guided by professionals.

Through searching on the Internet, we found that TF Family is a teen idol group made by Time Fengjun.
The agency said they had trained WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan in Japanese and Korean training mode for two years.
What were the lives of these Chongqing trainees like?
We made a visit to the training school, to reveal the star-making story behind the scene.

**Reveal**

## Genuine, Real Deal

*[Image]*  
*The trainees are 8- to 12-year-old boys, no girl recruited.*

Recently, S.M. Entertainment of Korea released a brand-new group EXO-M in China.
Every member has special talents, besides charming appearances.
Lay(ZHANG Yi-xing) had been a trainee in Korea for four years before having the chance to debut.
In Korean show biz, most stars were once trainees in famous talent agencies.
Differing from the star-making through draft shows rising in China in recent years, Japanese and Korean operation mode is very mature, with the procedure of passing audition, signing contract, receiving training, being packaged and debut.
We interviewed Mary, the manager of the training department of TF Family, on 28th May, showed us the lives of the Chongqing trainees for the first time.

### Selection Criteria: Handsome and Cute Are the Most Important

"8 to 12 years old, positive appearance, well-developed figure, coordinate body;
interested in vocal music, street dance, etc.;
have ambition of developing in arts or entertainment."
These are the recruiting requirements of TF Family for trainees, which can be found on several sites and Baidu Tieba.

"These are the basic requirements," Mary said.
The agency initially sought trainees from elementary schools of Chongqing,
"through teachers' recommendation and the seek by ourselves."
Soon, they found this blanket scout quite ineffective, and time-wasting.
Thus, turned the searching area to art schools and Children's Palaces.

Once they find a suitable child, the "scout" will contact his parents, and take a primary test.
"We organize professional teachers for evaluation, the children show their adept performances in dances, songs, or showmanship, let the teachers find their talents and potentials."
According to Mary, well-featured look is mandatory, but they treasure the potentials the most -- they should be handsome, and cute.

"Passing the test doesn't mean he becomes a trainee, there's a three-month probation."
It is said that the child under probation will be trained by professional teachers, including dance, vocal music, instruments, showmanship, performance, magic show, creation skills, with the premise of not intervening the school study."
The training is mostly carried on weekends and vacations, and completely free."

### Elimination? Fans Decide It

During the probation, TF Family will continuously test the children, the qualified ones can remain.
"We use it so as to select and cultivate the potential ones." Mary said.

Besides the tests, how many fans they have, and how popular are they among netizens, is an important index.
"During the probation, we will gradually release their training videos, art photos, and makeup photos on the Web."
Mary told us that these will be uploaded to not only the official Weibo account and the children's personal account, but also several websites and Baidu Tieba.
A staff will collect the comments and opinions, as well as the number of fans.

"Although the number of fans doesn't make the decision, but fans usually determine a star's popularity."
It is known that stars often show their gratitude to fans at award ceremonies.
In addition, fans may influence the rank of charts via their support, which guarantees the authority and justice of the results.

It is said that Time Fengjun had recruited three groups of trainees, since their foundation in 1999.
The first group contained nearly 20 trainees, only one remained now.
Mary said, they started searching at places like children's training organisations and Children's Palaces from the second recruit,
"because the children there have clear targets, and their basics are more sound."

### Training: Start From Scratch

One who passed the probation is called a trainee.
"According to our rule, we will sign a contract with the child's parents, to let him be our trainee."
Mary said, the agency is still experimenting, it doesn't sign with trainees formally, but strictly executes as the Japanese and Korean training mode.

It is known that Japanese and Korean trainees debut through their real talents, not back-doors or "underlying rules".
Famous groups like H.O.T., TVXQ, Super Junior all started as trainees.
They should start from scratch, receive cruel training and bear bored life, even if you already have unique skills.
Keep training, and waiting for a chance.

"Our training includes vocal music, dance, instruments, performances, magic show, showmanship, creation skills, and so on.
We have professional teachers to teach one on one, to shape an entertainer in all aspects."
Mary said, after the appraisal by their professional evaluation team, outstanding trainees can debut from well-known entertainment agencies, others can get professional development in arts.
Furthermore, they can help trainees to attend auditions from film and television companies, and to get the opportunity of performing in variety shows on TV of the partners.

Mary stated that the cultivation before debut is the most valued section.
According to the trainee's personal situation, the time varies from several months to seven or eight years, mostly two to three years.

> Flow Chart of Training Mode

> Audition → Probation(3 months) → Signed Trainee → Training(with Promotion, 1 to 5 years) → Debut / Graduate, Continue School Study

### Run At a Loss

In Japanese and Korean training mode, agencies give the training with no charge.
How does the agency make a profit? Mary said, they will gain after the trainee's debut.
They are investing at present, the benefit lies in the long-term effect.
"Training agencies lacking economic strengths are usually dragged down.
This is an opportunity for us on the contrary."

"Our boss is a Beijinger doing business on real estate in Chongqing.
He is an entertainer himself, and found the promising prospect of the art training market in Chongqing.
So he introduced the training mode in."
We were told that the agency and Beijing Time Fengjun have signing priority in the trainees' debut, they may get returns from the following managing businesses.
Children are free to exit if they are unwilling to continue, or have to focus on the school study, after some days' training.

"Besides the free training, we also provide transportation allowance and free room and board."
Mary said, at weekends, the trainees were usually sent by parents, but in vacations, it would be inconvenient for those living in other counties.
"We have teachers to take care of them, and be responsible for their daily lives."

"We are cultivating future super stars, not child stars."
Mary presented that after two years running, there are two groups of children taking training at present.
Years later, after grow up, they will debut as a group.
"Now everything is under testing, over ten children has been trained, including WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan."

He left a wrong number, almost missed the chance."
According to GONG's recalling on 29th May, it was a day two years ago, when WANG Jun-kai was found by the agency, he left a wrong number unintentionally.
The agency thought he was unwilling to get trained.
Only after the agency went to his school for the second time and made contact with his father, that his family know the matter.

GONG said, because Jun-kai likes singing and music, his teacher thought he's good at the understanding of music, and suggested him to study there.
After making a visit to the agency, she thought they were not cheating, and agreed on the training.

WANG Yuan, who will be graduated from primary school, also likes music from childhood.
His mother ZHANG Ting-fen was still doubting when the staff of TF Family drove to their home and called her.
After a visit, she felt that the agency's quite good at the scale, the environment, and the professionalism of the teachers.

### Sang on Street to Be Adapted to Stage

WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan are among the first and second trainees respectively, their training includes vocal music, dance, performance, etc.
They said in a TV programme that in order to be adapted to stage, they had sang on the street.
To boys under fourteen, this was quite a challenging experience.

In just over one year, on the number of comments on Sina Weibo, and the sign-in rate of personal Baidu Tieba, WANG Jun-kai ranks the top among child stars (on singing) aged below fourteen.
His cover of "Yige Xiang Xiatian, Yige Xiang Qiutian"(一个像夏天，一个像秋天, literally: "One Likes Summer, One Likes Autumn") with WANG Yuan has been reposted over 40,000 times on Sina Weibo, the video got 5 million hits(up to Sept. 2012).
This is the record of Internet coverings of child stars in China.

In Sept. 2012, WANG Jun-kai's cover of "Wode Gesheng Li"(我的歌声里, literally: "In My Song") was recommended by Youku, 56.com, and Renren, and was reposted by the official Weibo account of "The Voice of China"(中国好声音), the hottest talent show in China.
The video was viewed over a million times in one week, and reposted by many on Weibo.

It's easy to tell that this two child stars were specially trained, unlike other grass-root peers popular on the Web, they were calm in front of camera.
Differing from other peers featured in cute, their performances were mostly moving love songs, their skills and actions were quite mature.

### Being Popular Through Covering of Leslie CHENG's Song

"My mother is a fan of Leslie CHENG, I want to sing a song for her."
WANG Yuan's and WANG Jun-kai's mothers are fans of CHENG, on the 10th anniversary of CHENG's death, the sons' singing as a gift unexpectedly got popular.

When CHENG passed away ten years ago, WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan were still in kindergarten.
Every year after, on the day, recalling programmes on TV broadcasts, his films replay.

WANG Jun-kai said, his mother likes CHENG very much.
In her influence, he saw many of his films, and sang his songs.
We were growing with his films and songs, such as "A Chinese Ghost Story", and "Wind Blows On".
The boys decided to make a special commemoration with a cover of his song.

The video got over 400,000 hits in several days, and became the most concerned covering video during the commemoration.
Some fans wanted to give presents to the boys, and there were foreign fans among them.

But the two boys were quite free and easy.
They didn't find changes in everyday life, just go to school and get training as usual.
"We are just doing what we like, we don't have other thoughts."

### Parents: Let Them Do What They Like

WANG Yuan's and WANG Jun-kai's parents knew little about their popular on the Web.
They said, let them do what they like, if it doesn't affect the study.

"At the back of being famous, it is hardship."
GONG Hui-sheng said Jun-kai had once complaining about the toil and ache, it made her aching.
But she thought it's better to make efforts on training than just playing out.

"It's beyond compare with the gain and pay of my friends' children.
TF Family never charged anything."
ZHANG Ting-fen also said the agency pay much respect to children's school study, that they never make any arrangement on weekdays.
They would get children to the bus after training, which made them feel relieved at children's safety and other matters.

Mentioning this Mother's Day, ZHANG Ting-fen was quite happy.
She said that seeing her child's greeting message, she felt he's becoming sensible, this was the first time it happened.

To the children's dream, their parents were supportive;
to the public's concern, they were treating with usual mind.

*Sociologist PU Qi-jun*

"Such a training is not bad to parents."
The dean of Sociologist Institute of Chongqing Academy of Social Sciences PU Qi-jun said on 29th May, on the training of child stars.
He stated that all educational training should not violate the physical and mental characteristics of children, adults should not impose their own will on children, parents should focus on whether the children can get happiness in such activities.

PU said, he saw many cases of mistaken out-of-school training:
The parents have great expectations on their children, force them to take too much training.
On weekends, the parents pick them up from one class to another, from dawn till dark.
"The result is not good, usually the reverse," the children are lack of rest, very exhausted.

"As to children's dream of being stars, parents should have common minds, and give correct guidance."
PU said, proper attendance of suitable draft shows is good at improving children's abilities, such as expression and adaptation.
But parents should not be utilitarian, it is not encouraged to impose their own dream to the children in spite of the children's own interests and development needs.

**New Power**

*Child stars on the stage in good manners*

## Chongqing Trainees, Reserves of Future Stars

Trainees originally appeared in Korean show biz.
Most stars should be trainees of well-known entertainment agencies at first.
But stars from Chongqing usually came from arts colleges or were accidentally found by agencies.

The training mode in China is under development, but there are companies practising, a new power is coming.
On 30th May, XU Ke, the general manager of Chongqing Canyin(重庆璨音文化传播有限公司) said, training mode is more suitable for Asian entertainment markets, the entertainer grows with the agency, they know each other very well, they link closer.

### Elimination Rate in Chongqing is Higher Than in Japan/Korea

It is known that a Korean trainee is trained in singing and dances, physique, and other aspects, the room and board is also arranged by the agency.
Half of the trainees will leave in two years.
Popular groups TVXQ and Super Junior are trainees of about the same time.

The training mode is under development in Chongqing, the elimination rate may be higher."
XU said, seeing from the first trainees of TF Family, over ten were on probation and signed, only one remained at last, the rate is much higher.

### Not Influenced by Fans

In Korea, TV stations, entertainment agencies, and film production companies formed a sound selecting mechanism.
They promote auditions via media, and attendees have equal chances, but the auditions are not open, the results are decided by the organisers, will not be influenced by fans.

XU said, differing from Korean, the fans' opinion is an important index in the selection of Chongqing trainees, the agency cares more about popularity than strength.
The popular of grass-root entertainers on the Web in recent years are very good examples.

### Korean Entertainers Need Cosmetic Operations

Cosmetic operation is usually a must before a Korean Entertainer debuts, a trainee may take such an operation.
There is a clear procedure: everyone should take a "camera test" at regular time, be filmed from all angles, and then be evaluated by professionals.
It makes judgements of whether he/she needs cosmetic operations.
They will take operations following the evaluation, to make them perfect on camera.

XU Ke said, though the cosmetic operation market in Chongqing is hot, operations for entertainers before debut were rare.
According to his information, the environment in Chongqing is not mature for entertaining, entertainers are mostly singing in pubs to make livings, don't have money for such operations.

### 70% to the Agency

During the two-year training, the agency pays all.
For large agencies, over 1 million yuan(in RMB) will be spent on one trainee each year.
To ensure the paybacks, the contract between the agency and the trainee is quite long, mostly 5 to 10 years, some even never expires.
Large agencies get bigger cuts, usually 70% to 80%.

"Many entertainers in Chongqing are still working on their own, the market is unordered."
XU said, there are three kinds of entertainers in Chongqing:
A-list and B-list actors and actresses from Chongqing;
entertainer groups like theatrical troupes and singing and dancing troupes;
and a large number of common singers and entertainers underground.
Compared to the mature platform of Taiwan or foreign countries, they don't have chances, they don't have a supporting platform.
Training mode may provide a chance for them, but Japanese and Korean mode does the cultivating from young.

### Chongqing Market is to Be Developed

Japanese and Korean training mode is selecting some potential children, gradually choosing some as formal trainees to perform contracts.
And push them to the show biz after several years when thing are ready.
They gain achievements due to the mature mechanism and agencies, they are working in a market with integrated commercial and industrial chain.

"But Chongqing is a market to be developed."
XU said, most organisations in Chongqing charges for the training, provides professional teaching on improving children's self-quality and art talents.
A organisation recruiting trainees runs for free, the company make huge investments at first, let the trainees to make preparation for being a formal entertainer.
The training mode in China is under development, but there are companies practising, a new power is coming.
