## Talk with TFBOYS: About abs, height, and "wu-bai"
*["wu-bai", double silly, a slang extended from "er-bai-wu"(二百五) in Chinese, which means someone is silly or stupid.]*

"They are coming."
Following a staff's sound, three boys in white came into the room -- WANG Jun-kai in the front, WANG Yuan the second, and YI Yang-qian-xi the next.
On 18th August, at the backstage of CCTV "Tiaozhan Bu Keneng"(挑战不可能, literally: "Challenge Impossible"), three boys of the popular group TFBOYS came for our interview.

Unlike other idols, the fifteen-year-old boys didn't spend much time on their shapes.
WANG Jun-kai passed his phone to the dresser, YI Yang-qian-xi sniffed noses, WANG Yuan stretched arms, and the talk began.
During the interview, they made fun of each other, or smiled happily.
It may be due to their youthfulness or the relaxed atmosphere, it is hard to connect the boys in front with a top idol group with millions of fans.

During the interview, many staff cannot help laughing.
WANG Jun-kai said he's scared of ghosts, WANG Yuan had confident on his charm, and YI Yang-qian-xi expressed that it's normal to have abs.
As to the "ten-year promise", they assured that they will make every effort to show better performances in this ten-year.

### About abs, height, and "wu-bai"

*[Q - Phoenix Ent., K - Karry(WANG Jun-kai), R - Roy(WANG Yuan), J - Jackson(YI Yang-qian-xi), A - All(TFBOYS)]*

**Q:**
Is the challenge in the show difficult? I've heard that you are a little unwell in the rehearsal.  
**J:**
It's fine in the beginning, but I felt stomach distension after the rotation, maybe it's because I ate too much for lunch.

**Q:**
What are you scared of in life?  
**K:**
I'm scared of ghosts in the evening.

**Q:**
Are the other the same?  
**A:**
Yes.

**Q:**
Many fans saw Jackson's abs in the dance at the fan meeting, I wonder if any of you are exercising on abs.  
**K:**
I'm not. My teacher said it's hard to grow taller after gaining muscles, so I will only do the exercise after I get the certain height.  
**R:**
I have the exercises, 20 to 30 sit-ups every day.
I have abs, but they said it's because I'm thin.
But I think it's normal for such a charming man to have abs.

**Q:**
Karry mentioned "the certain height", what is your ideal height?  
**K:**
1.8-metre is enough, I'm not too eager.

**Q:**
Jackson, you've said you are "gao leng"[高冷, a buzzword in China, originally means "act as an elite and be indifferent to others". But usually simply means "calm and cool".], what do you think about the other two?  
**J:**
As a whole, they are "wu-bai".  
(Imagine that...)

**Q:**
Who do you like the most?
**K:**
Jay Chou(周杰伦). [In fact, he's a judge, not a competitor]

**Q:**
Do you read your fans' Weibo posts?  
**K:**

I read comments of the fans.

### Keep on striving, have a concert in a large stadium in ten years

**Q:**
Many people are shocked about your performances on the anniversary, have you thought about the result of the "ten-year promise"?  
**K:**
The promise is special for us, I think the concert will be outstanding, much different from the fan meeting this year, it will be more incredible.  
**R:**
We will grow and change in this ten-year, we will show our growth on the concert.
The concert in a very large stadium will show you a grown-up TFBOYS.  
**J:**
The concert is meaningful for us, we will keep on striving, I hope everyone wait and see.

**Q:**
The new song "Big Dreamer" has just released, it's also youthful and motivational like many other works.
Have you thought of trying other styles?  
**K:**
We will, we like to challenge songs of different styles.

**Q:**
As you've attended in "Up Idol"(偶像来了) recently, which one do you like the most among the actresses in the show?
Will you attended in more reality shows?  
**K:**
I admire everyone of them because they are very beautiful and talented seniors, their acting is great.
We should learn from them as we are still freshmen.  
**R:**
It's hard to tell, they are all divas, I like everyone of them.  
**J:**
They are great actresses.
Such as Lin Ching-Hsia(or Brigitte Lin, 林青霞), my parents also like her very much.
I was excited at the time, and I wish to see her again in the future.
