**Part 4**

# Purely Natural "Meng"
*[This title appears in P39]*

What is "meng"? Something to eat?
In this world surrounded by "meng" properties, it's difficult to move a step without such skills.
But you should be mentioned that being natural is proper, pretending to is bad.
Little boys are of course full of "meng"-styles, the fans who call themselves "guai shushu"(literally: "weird uncles") and "guai ayi"(literally: "weird aunts") [these are the callings of TFBOYS' male and female fans who are much older than them] are also very "meng" in their ardently love.
But when communicating with the boys, to be honest and frank, you shouldn't fancy to be called "bro" or "sis", they won't get your inner thought, but really call you "uncle" or "aunt".
*[This paragraph appears in P39, but is the foreword of Part 4.]*

## TFBOYS' Thirty "Meng"-Styles
### More than thirty, to be discovered~

![Image](/../pics/20140523MMFD009.jpg)

#### Young

Once seeing the boys, those crazy sister fans and auntie fans will be envious:
“What a youth! What a fair skin! Full of collagen!!!"
Looking at their milky skins, it's hard to control oneself not to pinch.
(Just imagining, don't be irritated ^_^
Well, that pinching hand you previously saw is not mine.)

![Image](/../pics/20140523MMFD010.jpg)

#### Physical Skills

Roy's skills in basketball had been mentioned before, and Jackson's good at Taekwondo which Roy judged as "violent sport".
And Karry will play basketball when he has time, but he doesn't have much, especially when he's preparing for the High School Entrance Examination.

![Image](/../pics/20140523MMFD011.jpg)

#### "Xue Ba"(学霸)

Karry and Jackson are good at study, while Roy's not.
(Roy said he is when he's in elementary school, just lacked behind in middle school.)
Jackson had even ranked first in the grade.
Karry always brought his homework when attending the performances.
It is said that too much hobbies affects school studies, but after looking at Jackson and Karry, you'll find the saying's cheating.

#### Underachiever

Once when they talked about the semester's final exams, Roy said, "My aim is Grade Top 3."
Jackson and Karry responded at once, "You? Not the Bottom 3?"
and Jackson continued, "My aim is Grade Top 5. Karry, we can look him down after the exam."
Don't worry, Roy, things will be okay when the vacation comes.

#### Specialities

Roy is good at playing basketball, and he once said that he used to won Karry and Jackson in slippers.
(But Karry argued that he was the one in slippers.)
And Jackson's specialities are too many to be listed here.
But he loves dancing the most, and had attended many large dancing contests.

#### Voices

The voices of boys before changing are pure and clean, like their fair skins.
Karry's voice is soft and mellow, makes you feel calm and warm.
Jackson's is clear and silvery, makes the singing sonorous and pleasant.
To Roy, I was shocked the first time I listened to his singing, his voice's resounding and resonant, very suited for high pitches.

#### "Chi Huo"
*(吃货, one who loves eating, somewhat similar to "foodie")*

At the backstage of the ceremony, when asked what's in their bags, Roy took out a packet of cookies, then a box of chocolates, then a bag of lollipop~
This boy is definitely a "chi huo" -- Period.
Besides, there is a well-known "chi huo" - Qian Zong.
According to his words, "I am growing".
It is said that he can eat up food for three person.
Even so, he is always saying, "I got hungry."

### Positive Motivation

The boys' persistence and firmness in chasing dreams brought them to their longing stages, and they are transferring the steady flow of the positive motivation to the fans.

---

*P39*

#### Brotherhood

There are always things to talk about for the often-departed guys.
Took advantage of the ceremony in Beijing, the boys got a good eating specially, with Qian Zong as the host.
Before that, when Qian Zong went to Chongqing, the other two also entertained him well~

![Image](/../pics/20140523MMFD012.jpg)

#### Family Love

Besides TFBOYS, other members (like LIU Zhi-hong(刘志宏)) of TF Family played in "Study Room In Boys' School".
In other sections of "TF Teens GO!", like "TF Family News", you can easily feel the warmth and love in this large family.

![Image](/../pics/20140523MMFD013.jpg)

![Image](/../pics/20140523MMFD014.jpg)

#### Consciousness as an Idol

When asked who has the most idol burdens, Karry and Jackson pointed to Roy, and Karry explained:
“When he is sweating all over after playing basketball, he will stay away from fans.
To those who recognised him, he will say, 'you were mistaken, I'm not WANG Yuan.'"

#### Chatty

This "chatty" contains a little "verbose".
Every time staying with Karry, Roy will be looked down.
Even when Roy was answering questions alone, Karry kept mentioning him, "ah, you got it wrong."
"You said so many 'and'."
"I'm more handsome than you."
Then Roy would show a pitiful face.

#### Reserved Models

It's easy to find their changes in a short time, such as the height.
Karry is already 1.73 metres tall (written in Baidu Baike), Roy is supplementing nutrition every day (see his Weibo pictures), Jackson has quite a big appetite.
Their dressing is stylish now, after they reach 1.8 metres tall, it will be unimaginable.

![Image](/../pics/20140523MMFD015.jpg)

#### Compassion

Karry and Roy had sang "Yangcong" with the cooperation of TF Band, aiming at looking for the band drummer WANG Yi-feng(王译锋)'s mother, to celebrate the Children's Day with him.
The video had been reposted by the song's composer Ashin of Mayday(五月天), and broadcast on CTi TV(中天電視, Chung T'ien Television), which made many parents take out time with their children.

---

*P40*

#### High EQ

Karry joined TF Family long ago, he could well-balance his school life and the training at first, but was difficult to stand when the study load was getting heavier.
But he insisted, because it is his dream.
Such a little boy knew bearing for the dream, it really worth giving him a thumb-up.

#### Purity

Children in these ages are pure, and many Clovers like them because of their purity.
They look like lucid spring water, which can purify one's heart when sees them.

#### Chongqing Dialect

Compared to foreigners' accent of Chinese, Chinese mandarin dialects are lovelier, suitable for being cute without countrified feelings.
WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan's Chongqing dialect accent is cute!
Don't you like their accent in the shows? Don't you think the prolonged end syllables are cute?

#### Virgo

A Virgo is necessary in an idol group, just like WANG Jun-kai in TFBOYS.
Virgo, among the Zodiac signs, is scoffed the most.
But actually, Virgos are just stricter with "others".
This leader is a standard Virgo "masochism".
[Some words omitted, don't know what was said.]
He was strict at team-mates' hair styles, sometimes even arranged their hairs by himself.
Jackson and Roy were so lucky to have acquainted a diligent Virgo.

#### NGs

It's awkward to look at each other for boys, Roy and Karry would laugh and make an NG.
When the boys played hard and forgot the camera, they would make an NG.
When Jackson was out of state and couldn't catch up, he would make an NG...
Well, the reactions and the loud laugh after the NG were also funny.

#### Imposing Manners

The leader WANG Jun-kai stays the longest in TF Family, experienced ups and downs before the debut.
He possesses the maturity which is beyond his age.
Jackson's reserve reveals a feeling of grave and dignified bearing which is also beyond his age.
Qian Zong, we Clovers are willing to kneel down to you!

#### Height Gaps

173cm, 167cm, and 163cm (growing) -- the three boys took photos with milk, followed with many sister fans and auntie fans yelling "drink more, grow higher".
Although the "height gaps" might seem adorable, considering height is a prerequisite of being a "moving poster", it's easy to understand the delivery of milk as a present.
They must be much taller!

![Image](/../pics/20140523MMFD016.jpg)

#### Growing up

For Roy, Karry, and Jackson, the greatest advantage is the age.
They may be the youngest idols in Chinese music circle.
For many fans, seeing them getting better and better is just like accompanying their own children to grow up.
For the fans in the same age, their growth can easily evoke a strong echo in them.

#### "Gao Leng"
*[高冷, a buzzword in China, originally means "act as an elite and be indifferent to others". But usually simply means "calm and cool".]*

Sometimes "gao leng" can also be cute.
Such as, when Roy was excitedly talking in front of the camera, Qian Zong sitting aside kept eating dinner.
Such as, when Roy and Karry were making up a script, Qian Zong standing away was staring at a pond and pondering.
Such as, unlike talkative Roy, reserved Qian Zong was really "gao leng".
Such as ...
In short, Qian Zong was always emitting the feeling of a "domineering president".
(Don't mention that quite active and exaggerated Jackson at the moment.)

#### Well-bred

Their actions and manners showed they were well-bred.
They would specially get off the car and bow to the waiting fans in the airport.
When appeared at an award ceremony for the first time, the three boys' politeness and dedicated attitude deeply impressed others.

#### Persistence

It was a hard time for them from the beginning.
From one of the selected trainees to being loved by many, WANG Jun-kai stayed here, he persisted with the utmost determination, and even all the hopes seemed disappeared.
WANG Yuan and WANG Jun-kai persisted in making covering videos, only for an opportunity.
Early-boosted Qian Zong persisted in improving both study and talents.
And that's exactly what an excellent fellow in neighbour class looks like.

#### Compulsive Character

"Someone's taking zombies to follow me from last night.
I've removed them.
Would you please don't do that again?
Or, I have to remove them tonight."
This is what our Leader WANG posted on Weibo.
To the stole-in zombies among the countless new followers, WANG Jun-kai expressed his dislike and opposition.
An awestruck obsession.
Due to his heavy study load, this important mission had been delivered to a staff.

#### "Jie Di Qi"
*[接地气, a buzzword in China, generally means be in compliance with common people, or stay real, be grounded.]*

Leader WANG has now thrown himself into "Tianli 38 Sets"(天利38套, a guidance book series for entrance examinations), which is so familiar for almost all the students and those who had once been students.
They have their own style in school uniforms, while many others can't.
"Exams will start tomorrow.
Someone told me writing notes for blessing will do!
So I wish -- Chinese 110, Maths 130, English 125, and Physics 95. Please!"
Such a devout praying is exactly what we all had done.
That Is So Real And Grounded!

#### Brother Complex

In Qian Zong's Weibo, you can easily find his younger brother
-- taking a photo with him in the arms, dressing him up like a panda, basking in the sunshine with him in the arms, watching a film with him, kissing him in the face ...
The two brothers are so cute!
Roy and Karry also like him very much, they would like to compare something resilient and elastic to his face.

## Which Is Your Type?

It's wonderful to see their Weibo posts.
Their followers are greatly increasing, the comments and reposts are multiplying
-- from 100+ in the beginning, to 10,000+ at present.
Among these huge amount of comments, we can take a peek at the commons' viewpoints, the fans' ardent support, the aunties' soft advices, and strangers' puzzling.
Which one is your type?

**Type 0** -- Exciting to be the first comments and becoming speechless:

1. 啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊!

5. yyy came!!!

10. (´；ω；`)

**Type 2** -- Being both a true lover and a trouble maker:

1. Seeing all these encouraging and positive comments, I just want to make some ridicules instead, but can't type them here...
2. Finished your "Tianli 38 Sets"?
3. I'm a sister, not an aunt...
4. Can you read the letter? Use BBK Dian Du Ji(步步高点读机, a reading machine of BBK, used for teaching children simple Chinese and English) when you can't recognize a word.
5. That's clever to seek fans for solving the homework. But the fans are helpless though they're older.
6. Saw the dark past. Hahahahaha!
7. Meitu Xiuxiu fever!!
*[Meitu Xiuxiu(美图秀秀) is a picture processing software which can easily decorate and beautify a photo.
Some netizens use the name to hint that a person have to make some process to make their photo nice.]*
8. Idol burden's heavier!
9. Hahahahaha the bangs are blunt cut!

Their agency's so poor, where comes the money?

**Type 3** -- You're so charming, how can I not love you:

1. I love you, just because it's you.
2. My goodness! This is a 14-year-old boy, so freaking charming!
3. Remember to smile, it can warm other's heart~
4. I like your eyes!
5. Soooo cuuuute!!!!!
6. I had once read a novel, the hero with canine teeth bewitched the heroin in his smile.
I didn't know what does canine teeth look like, and didn't think it to be good-looking after knowing it.
Until I met you!
Your smile is really really nice, the canine teeth are so cute!
7. Don't be like that! My whole heart was captured!
8. I love you, I love you.
9. I want to pinch your face. I want to pinch your face. I want to pinch your face. I want to pinch your face. I want to pinch your face. I want to pinch your face. I want to pinch your face. I want to pinch your face. I want to pinch your face. I want to pinch your face.
10. Many novels wrote the hero with slanted eyes, high-bridged nose, thin lips, both domineering and adorable, masculine, posh voice, nice character, good-looking in white shirt and black coat or whatever clothes, perfect shape like a model, shyness sometimes but imposing in big occasions, a not-too-slim body, attractiveness when concentrating, sometimes a singer or a star...
I would rather condemned the author how can a man be so good, now I know that they are writing about you...

**Type 4** -- Miss you but your study is the most important:

1. Fight for the exam! Don't come here! We can amuse ourselves well!
2. It's verbose but I want to say:
Don't worry about zombie followers these days, focus on your study!
Study hard, then you'll have more choices in your life.
Though you may not recognize this at present, it's a critical moment, keep calm!
3. Fight for the exam!
Two months are not very long, we sisters and aunties can wait.
Wish you make a good preparation, don't care about the stress.
Good luck to you, and get a good score!
4. Fight for the entrance exam!
Keep your resolve, and you'll win!
5. Remember to prepare for the high school lessons after the activities in summer vacation,
the competition now is fierce, the agency is quite clear about this,
don't be deceived by the flashing popularity, study makes no wrong.
6. Won't it be a stress for him that he may thought the fans' expectation on him is too high?
Don't be stressed, just be normal, because you've already done very well.
Don't take on too much pressure.
Though the exam is near, enough rest is also very important.
7. Fight for the exam, don't be stressed!
Take care of yourself, don't be sick; beware of hypoglycaemia.
You are such a gentle child for friends and fans; your thankfulness is too much...
It's so nice of insisting on your dream...
I can tell that you are growing in good condition, it makes me relieved...
Keep your initial determination.
8. Fight for the exam!
I believe you will take it seriously!
The road ahead will be difficult, but you are the walker, and we always support you!
Brave young man, you will finally grow up, you will be many people's aim!
9. You will be better!!!!!
10. Focus on your homework! Drink more milk! Take good sleep! Be taller! Don't care about other things!

**Type 5** -- It feels complex of seeing you being more and more popular:

1. 130,000 to 930,000[the number of followers of Weibo account], what a tempo, in less than a year!
2. So popular recently... It'd stayed on the Search Chart for maybe several weeks...
3. You are not on Weibo, but you are everywhere on Weibo... You are busy studying, but I still can't study well!
4. Sometimes I was thinking, when you are still in school, when I can still find you, when you are still such a cute next-door boy, I should see you, listen to you, embrace you in a hurry.
After you grow up, I won't follow up your pace anymore, because you walk so fast.
Finally, I were among the countless fans surrounding the stage, looking up at the glorious you.
Sometimes I would selfishly hope you not to grow up.
5. Among so many comments, can you see me? I was just an insignificant one among them, right?
6. All posts watched again. Huge changes in these two years.
7. Ai, being on the "Hot Weibo Posts Chart" brought troubles, I saw some aunties are worrying.
As grown-ups, there's someone who didn't know what they are saying, just keep scolding.
Do you know them?
Even though you knew a little, those were mostly rumours.
You won't be affected a little, but you are maligning a boy who's less than 14.
God's watching, take care.
Your characters are much poorer than children's.
8. TF's going to be popular, it seems that my words were always efficacious~
9. 30,000+ comments, now know the aunties' power.
10. Ah! Now every post will be on the "Hot Weibo Posts Chart", they are more famous, I'm sad!

**Type 6** -- Always thinking too much:

1. I read many posts about your school life, don't know if true or false, exaggerated or more serious.
Whatever it was, I'm sorry for that, we are saying we love you, but can't protect you.
2. Don't press them to post, they are very tired preparing for exams, shoot, training, and now attending ceremony.
So don't press~ They will if they have time. Give them time to rest~ Be considerate if you love them~
3. Ai, don't know what to say...
4. Though posted last year, it's still a cherishing memory, although I just knew you a month ago. You are so cute those days, though now cuter! But I like that puerile feeling... I'm a weird sister fan...
5. Dear boys, do take care of yourselves.
6. Boys, you are so slim! You must eat more!!! Don't be so slim!!!
7. Aches for my sons...
8. We won't make you lose!!!!!
9. I'm scared if the agency didn't treat you well...
10. Baby, feel at ease to sleep well every day.

10. The comments are funny.

### Words to Them

Sometimes there are loads of words to say, but can hardly decide where to begin with.
These are just a corner of the Clovers' expressions, but there's no need to say them out, because they are all in each other's heart.

Which one do you feel the same?

**[ID omitted]:**
Karry, our Leader WANG, thank you for your persistence and responsibility, it made us meet TFBOYS;
Yuan-yuan, our little sunshine, thank you for your smile and tenderness, it gave us the power of healing;
Qian-qian, our little Prince Charming, thank you for your bravery and striving, it made us believe that you will be the brightest stars!
It's so nice to meet you! I love you!

**[ID omitted]:**
Wish you study well and grow up quickly~

**[ID omitted]:**
I like Karry's canine teeth, his smile can always enchant me;
I like Roy's singing, his voice softens my heart;
I like Qian Zong's dance, every move shines brightly.

**[ID omitted]:**
I knew Karry on 15th Feb. 2013~ till now, I experienced their debut.
I wish the three boys go further, like what Karry said, always be together in every ten-year.

**[ID omitted]:**
I saw them quite often on my Weibo page, and didn't have much feeling at first.
After watching the live shows, I was totally attracted.
Wish I could have many ten-years with them.
Besides, we are nearly the same in age, it's happy to grow up at the same time.

---

*P47*

**[ID omitted]:**
I'm attracted by "Yangcong" when a friend reposted about 2 months ago, and became deeply in love with the three.
(They sang "Yangcong" last year... How blocked am I...)

**[ID omitted]:**
I fanned them from "Yangcong" in 2013, not too many people know them then, and I haven't thought that they would debut.
But time flies, in less than a year, they had a new companion, the life's happier.
Ten-year is long enough to change everything, ten-year is short that we are by your side!

**[ID omitted]:**
I knew them after a friend's repost.
I followed them because of a sudden heartbeat when seeing WANG Jun-kai's profile.
I like them because of their childish but vital songs.
I support them because of WANG Jun-kai's words -- "I haven't thought about other roads."
I will be the supporter on your arduous road.
The finale may not be flowers and honours, but you have fought for it, we have fought for it.

**[ID omitted]:**
It's early March.
Their sudden rise was like a dream.
I just can't catch up with it.
Whatever, wish they can do what they want, and be happy~

**[ID omitted]:**
I became a fan from 21st March.
This month seemed like half a lifetime, everyone who had experienced it know what dream and growing up is~
I wish their road from now on to be not so hard, wish they grow up and chase their dream happily!

**[ID omitted]:**
I was attracted by their true friendliness shown in the shows, and moved by their endeavours and unity.
Dream had left me far away, I hope they can realise their dream!
Boys, fighting!

**[ID omitted]:**
I noticed them from Karry and Roy's first cover in 2012, watching them growing up feels so good~

**[ID omitted]:**
I became a fan a month ago.
I don't have much to say, just don't be too tired, don't have too many worries, I wish to see them grow up in happiness.
And I wish they can do what they want, don't be afraid, don't give up, we are always here with you, and don't forget your initial determination.
I witnessed their start, and I will witness their finale.
I believe phoenix be born from fire.

**[ID omitted]:**
I became a fan after reading the interview in "Ma Lu ACG" [马鹿ACG, a manga magazine] about a month ago.
I hope the three be united as one, to realise the dream.
Those who love you can understand you, we will be guardians, always.

**[ID omitted]:**
I'm a fan from February.
I like the vitality and youthfulness they have, which makes me happy.
I want to say, study well and grow healthily, fight for your dream, don't give up, we will always be with you.

**[ID omitted]:**
Roy, Karry, and Jackson~ I knew Karry when he joined TF Family, this is why I support him now
-- nothing can be more surprising than watching a child you like from growing up step by step.
In three years, he is making progress and doing his best all the time.
And so do the other two.
One thing I most wanted is, that they become a symbol of mainland China's idol groups!
It should be the time!

**[ID omitted]:**
I fell in love with them when I'm watching "Teens GO"~
Then I watched their covers, Qian Zong's dances, and many fan-made videos...
I hope the three boys always support each other, stick to their characters, persist on their dream, be the best.
And remember to take care of yourselves, be confident, and study well~ grow up healthily~

**[ID omitted]:**
Concentrate on your study and play in delight.
Don't care much about the chaos from the outside world, you are boys with determined souls and pure eyes.
For me, you are my precious babies rather than idols.
Do grow up well and happily.
It's nothing special to say love, we are your companions.
Do we have the chance?
