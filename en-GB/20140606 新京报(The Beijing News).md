In the past year, many aunts and uncles were doubting who is LU Han, who is "EXO"; now the post-2000s come out
-- it is said that the standard of judging whether a person is in or out becomes "do you know TFBOYS".

How popular are TFBOYS?
There are over 100 million results about "TFBOYS" on Baidu, compared to 75 million about "Kim Soo Hyun"(김수현, 金秀贤).
When they recorded Happy Camp(快乐大本营, a top variety show in China) in May, the scalped tickets priced 6,000 yuan.
Thousands of fans came, which staffs of Hunan TV described as "flooded in".
Turn to their Weibo account, the post WANG Yuan wrote on 1st Jun. was reposted 85,000 times, commented nearly 80,000.
The post written by WANG Jun-kai on 10th May about his study caused 274,000 reposts and 280,000 comments, and the fans kept commenting tips and key points of the exam. Recently, they performed in a self-made drama on the web.

This is the time for post-2000s idols.
We interviewed the agency "Time Fengjun" that created TFBOYS, to discover the secret of the iconic group.
At the same time, we interviewed the first teen idol group in mainland China, RTA Teens, which had been disbanded, to discuss the stands and falls of teen idol groups.

## Who Are TFBOYS?

### Debut: Cover Pop Songs, Reposted By Mayday(五月天)

As a previously obscure talent agency, Time Fengjun was formerly a children's art training organisation, TF Family is their brand with many trainees in.
It can be seen from the documents that TF Family keeps selecting outstanding boys aged 5 to 12, Time Fengjun will provide systematic art training for free, including vocal music, dance, performance, etc.

According to TFBOYS's manager Yuna, the agency started to shoot covers of pop songs from 2010, and to test the responses from the web.
Though on small scale, they are accumulating the popularity.
On the Children's Day of 2013, the agency produced the cover of "Yangcong"(洋葱, onion) based on the story of one of the trainees.
It had been reported by TVs and newspapers, reposted by Ashin(阿信) of Mayday, and got over 30 million hits.
Senior fan Xiao-pi told us, "it is the peak of what a common cover can get."
At about the same time, the cover of "Yige Xiang Xiatian, Yige Xiang Qiutian"(一个像夏天，一个像秋天) had been reposted by Christine Fan(范玮琪), JJ Lin(林俊杰), and WANG Yue-xin(王栎鑫).

Seeing the ascending trend, the agency adjusted their strategy, made a brand-new group TFBOYS with WANG Jun-kai, WANG Yuan, and YI Yang-qian-xi of TF Family.
Though it had stated at a programme of Chongqing TV that the trainees won't debut before being adults.
In Xiao-pi's opinion, the birth of TFBOYS was "somewhat prompted by Mayday".

### Roles: Singing, Dancing, and Showmanship, Not One Less

Yuna said, the agency started recruiting the first trainees from 2009 for dozens of times, selected nearly a thousand children.
But as the training was held on weekends, which may influence the school study and daily life, many parents were pessimistic.
Besides, some trainees didn't meet the requirements, there were finally only over a dozen children left.

The reason of choosing WANG Jun-kai, WANG Yuan, and YI Yang-qian-xi is the sensible coordination.
"WANG Jun-kai is the facade, WANG Yuan is the vocal and emcee, YI Yang-qian-xi is the dancer, it is a very good coordination."
As to the vocals WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan, Yuna considered that they can get training together, and the most important is "their voices complement".

According to Mr. ZHANG, the marketer of a talent agency, the allocation follows "Xiao Hu Dui"(小虎队, Little Tiger):
"The leader WANG Jun-kai is Nicky Wu(吴奇隆), who is cool and charming, attracts fans of domineering idols.
WANG Yuan is Alec Su(苏有朋), who is cute and warm, attracts girls and mother fans.
YI Yang-qian-xi is Julian Chen(陈志朋), who is good at dancing and study, attracts the fans with worship.
This steady triangle can insure the coverage of the mainstream fans."

## Mode of TFBOYS

### Growing Under Fans' Concern

In Mr. ZHANG's opinion, the mode of TFBOYS is clearly what Johnny & Associates in Japan is executing.
Johnny & Associates recruits boys aged 10 to 14, performs training in spare time, including vocal music, instruments, dance, showmanship, performance, etc.,
to discover outstanding ones and push several ones together to the public after years of training.
Kimura Takuya of SMAP and Arashi are some of the successful ones of Johnny & Associates.

But Yuna said, compared to the training mode in Japan and Korea, TFBOYS is more focused on cultivating.
"Japanese and Korean idols are polished from the beginning, they are much less exposed before the debuts.
Our trainees don't have much time for the training, we have to train and publicize them at the same time, which emphasizes the growth with the fans' companionship."
Therefore, the agency released video clips in keeping with the hotspots on the web, and pushed out self-made weekly programmes to maintain the focus of fans.

As to the positioning, Japanese and Korean groups lean on the characteristics of idols, while TFBOYS the sense of "boys next door".
The fan Yu-shi identifies the strategy very much,
"WANG Jun-kai was not sensible at costume matching at first, but now he is much charming, shines out with great brilliancy on the stage of the award ceremony."
To her, the changing and growing from a plain boy to a big star is exactly what she want.
"I have a feeling of promoting them to be the stars, like the 'Super Girls' of 2005."

### School Study Is Important

It is said that most trainees in Japan and Korea are not traditionally good-scored students.
But in TF Family, an important requirement is the school study.
To Yuna, "the study expresses an attitude, the study records represent one's persistence."

In addition, the tradition differs much here,
"the trainees in Japan and Korea may ask for a long leave and focus on the training, but the parents of our children won't agree with that."
Therefore, they must select trainees from those good-scored ones,
"the three boys are studying in good schools, WANG Jun-kai and YI Yang-qian-xi ranks among the top, while WANG Yuan ranks in the middle."
In Mr. ZHANG's opinion, the good school study is a bonus point to them,
"Chinese are less tolerated to child stars who abandon their studies, and a good score is an encourage and inspiration to the fans, as many fans of them are middle school students."

## Fans' Views

### Charming, Less Experienced, Brings Reveries

There is another climate on the web that made them popular -- the "yaoi fandom"(or "slash fandom").

Yuna said, they had made the short play "Study Room in Boys' School" in order to train the acting skills, which was "just an acting lesson".
Unexpectedly, such an exercise became popular, with the reason of the subtle sentiment between two boys.

Mr. ZHANG said, "WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan had received training for years, one plays guitar, while the other keyboard.
The boys are handsome, young, and are good friends.
This brings reveries to the yaoi fandom.

Later, the videos of the play were added to the "danmaku"(弹幕, overlaid comments on a video, derived from Japanese "弾幕") video site Bilibili, attracted a large number of sister  and auntie fans.
The boys are charming, less experienced in performance, suits exactly for their reveries.

The fan Yu-shi said, she found many clothes of WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan in the play are reused or in female styles.
Yuna admired the sharp eyes and said, "they are in a age quite embarrassing, children's wear is not suitable, so we used female or neutral style clothes and modified a little."

To the trend of shipping on the web, Yuna took it as the personal joy of some fans.
"They like it and willing to imagine it on their own.
We don't mean it at all.
Teenage boys tends to be closer, it's normal."

## Lessons Drawn From Predecessors

**Disbanded RTA Teens:**  
**Unbalanced Personal Popularities & Capital Shortage**

Although many people take TFBOYS as the first teen idol group of China, we learned that the first should be "RTA Teens" created by "Day Day Up"(天天向上) and "Shaonian Jinhualun"(少年进化论, literally: "Evolution of Teenagers") of Hunan TV and Japanese-funded "RTA CULTURE"(悦音堂文化（北京）有限公司).
They can appear in two weekly TV programmes, and have their own variety show "Up! Juniors"(向上吧！少年) on Hunan TV and Sohu TV(a video website).
[This is wrong, the variety show was "Shaonian Jinhualun", while the programme that created the group was "Up! Juniors".]

With such a powerful endorsement, many insiders of show biz had a good prospect of RTA Teens.
However, after one year's glory and one year's plateau, it disbanded on the third year.
We learned that the biggest reason was the unbalanced personal popularity.
Among the four members, ZUO Yi(左溢) was previously a child star with many fans before the debut.
According to the fan Xiao-liu(pseudonym), when they arrived at an airport,
"there were usually only ZUO Yi's fans, or very few of other member's."
In order to control the situation, the agency often placed ZUO Yi to one side of the camera, gave out less tickets of programmes to his fans intendedly.
ZUO Yi's father told us, "there were times journalists wanted to report him alone, the agency didn't agree unless they report the whole team, which ended up with nothing."

On the other hand, capital shortage arose in the long training period.
It is said that RTA Teens was first promised to be forged by Japanese producers, would be trained in Japan for months.
But ZUO Yi said that they just made a 10-day's study tour there in the beginning, "and never went there again".
Later, the Japanese agency invested less and less, ZUO Yi's father complained,
"they didn't have much resources later, usually less than my own."

At the same time, each member of RTA Teens is good at dancing, singing, rock, or showmanship, they skilled differently, and were quite independent on their own minds.
They couldn't be adapted to the team at last.
ZUO Yi said, "we have different and distinctive specialties at first, but the dance moves and lyrics were equal, which was unable to take everyone's specialty into consideration."

After the contract expired, some including ZUO Yi claimed not to extend, the first teen idol group of China disbanded.
ZUO Yi took it as a relief, "everyone is free to do his own matters after that.
For me, I can learn guitar separately, and I have to put more effort into study as the college entrance exam is near.
Some of them are already in college, the time would be more unsuitable."

## Q&A

Alone with the common reasons of the disbandment, we collected some questions from the fans to ask the manager of TFBOYS.

**Q:**
Can they have a love affair?  
**A:**
They are junior middle school students facing two important entrance examinations, I don't think they have time to consider this matter.
We have requirements on that, and their parents won't allow it.

**Q:**
Do you worry about their face changing after grown up?  
**A:**
They are not too young to have such a change on the looks.
And the fans now are very faithful, many of them are not attracted by their looks, but the idea of the group.

**Q:**
How long are your contracts?  
**A:**
That's a suitable time period. The time in Korea is set to less than 7 years, that's more cruel than China, we don't sign for so long.

**Q:**
Will you accept commercial performances?  
**A:**
We don't in the near future.
They are changing voice now, we won't arrange too many activities.
We see more value in the age of seventeen and eighteen, such performances at present would lower their commercial value on the contrary.

**Q:**
Do you worry about the unbalance in their personal popularities?  
**A:**
It is somewhat balanced, many fans don't just like one of them.
There will be stumbles in children's lives indeed, but children are simple and pure, they don't fuss about so many things.
