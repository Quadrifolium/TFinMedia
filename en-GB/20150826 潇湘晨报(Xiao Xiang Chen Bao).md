As the dancer of TFBOYS, YI Yang-qian-xi is calm, reserved, and cool. He's good at Chinese calligraphy and school study, which entitled him as "xue ba"[学霸, one who's score ranks top in class or school].
This quiet boy has determined to be admitted to Peking University.
From this September, he will study in Changsha, the message made the fans excited, and expressed the willing of "watching him study in school".

The excitement is understandable, but for a 15-year-old boy, what he needs the most is a peaceful desk.
If you like him, please DO left him a free space for growth.

September's near, new term's beginning, child stars are going to study in school.
15-year-old YI Yang-qian-xi is among them.
As a member of the popular group TFBOYS, he has just passed the entrance examination, is going to study in Changsha.

Recently, there's a message on the web which says that YI will study in Changsha, the school is Changjun Meixihu Middle School.
This soon made the fans excited, "let's watch him study in school".

Yesterday, Yachuang Education, the school YI had extra lessons in Huaihua, said he had been admitted to a school in Changsha, "his registration is in Changsha, but whether he'll study there is unknown."

Yesterday, YI's father affirmed on the phone that he'll study in Changsha, but didn't tell the school name.

The agency Time Fengjun said, he will study in Changsha, "because his residence is registered in Hunan, he should take the College Entrance Examination there.
The education resource in Changsha is quite well, he can be adapted to the exam there."
The agency didn't want the school's name to be known, "the school is now their one and only private space, we wish to keep it concealed, not to disturb their study and the teaching of the school."

As to the message, the teacher of the teaching office of Changjun Meixihu Middle School had no idea about it.

Before the entrance examination, YI Yang-qian-xi is taking extra lessons in a school in Huaihua.

**About entrance examination**  
**Wished to concentrate on study, but had no peaceful desk**

YI Yang-qian-xi was born in Huaihua, Hunan, is now living in Beijing, studied in Affiliated Senior Middle School of BUCT(北京化工大学, Beijing University of Chemical Technology).
As his household registration is in Hunan, he should take the entrance examination in his birthplace.

For the examination, YI went back to Huaihua in late April.
Because of the difference between the test contents in Beijing and Hunan, his family took him to an extended learning class, and "requested for secrecy".

**Fans recognised him**  
**Searched from the ground floor to the target**

The school provided him teachers and exclusive room to teach him one-on-one.
A teacher said, YI studied here from late April for about 8 hours per day, "started from 8 AM to 6 PM, all five courses took turns".
Sometimes, it lasted until 9 PM, with two to three test papers as homework.
It may be 12 PM when he finished them.

Maybe it's because of the heavy load, the little star gradually became sleepy and sometimes late for class in the morning, and was scolded by teacher.
"The teachers are all famous in Huaihua, they are very strict, they don't care if you are a star."
After some times, he would check in on time.

This 15-year-old boy didn't talk much in the beginning, "he's serious in class, but too reserved, he just stared at his mobile phone even in the break time, seldom communicated with people."
A teacher found him too restrained, and bought him many snacks, which finally made him relaxed.
"He had smiles on, and would say hello to you.
Then I felt he's just a little boy, coaxing and humours work."

The preparation for the examination was full of twists and turns.
A teacher said, the school provided a separate room for him, kept the schedule totally secret, which brought him freedom for days, that he could study like a common student.
But before long, he was recognised by fans, the peace was suddenly broken.
"He was recognised at a canteen in the school, the students followed him in craze, and he never dared to get out again."

Later, fans also found his residence in Huaihua.
"His family lives in the 13th floor, the fans knocked on every door of the building from the ground, and besieged his house.
He cannot even get out, only after the bodyguards came that made him rescued."
After that, the agency provided him two guards, "they followed him every day, pick him up to and from the class."

**To stay away from trouble, he hid at home for a week before resuming class**

A teacher said, YI's attitude in study is quite well, and he's good at comprehension.
"He interacted actively with teacher, and was serious at study, was some sort of a 'xue ba'."
And his English and Maths are relatively better.

But as the teacher said, the examination result was not good enough, for several reasons.
First, he's studying in Beijing, the textbooks differs largely, which made the exam more difficult.
"He had to be adapted to the test contents of Hunan in a few months, that's really hard."

He intended to concentrate initially, but he cannot sit before a peaceful desk.
The teacher said, he was mostly attending events around in May, "the class was set to last for three months, but only over one month in practice."

The fans' containment also bothered this idol largely.
After been besieged, he hid at home for a week before resuming class.
"He's much stressed under such huge concern. He had a fever on the day of the exam, and wrote his answer sheet after finishing intravenous injection, was a little disordered."

The teacher said emotionally, "in fact, he has the ability of being admitted to Peking University. But his work and life is arranged full to the brim."

**Future plan**  
**Pick up every day, try not to disturb study**

From 2014, TFBOYS went popular, the three boys were surrounded everywhere they were in.
How to handle with the study and work after YI Yang-qian-xi study in Changsha?

The agency Time Fengjun said, they have agreements with the schools, including how to avoid disturbing the teaching, and how to have them take lessons in school.
"The schools managed well before, treated them as common students, and transfer the sense of not taking them as stars to other students."
The agency also have plans, "the school bans unrelated persons at study time, and we pick him up to and from school."

As to how to deal with the identities of both entertainer and student, the agency said, "they pour into study at school, the performances and events will be arranged on weekends and holidays."
"When they lack behind in some courses, we will provide extra lessons for them."

YI's father was also considering about it.
He said, he always cultivates the child to have the ability of entering Tsinghua University or Peking University, he will discuss with the agency.
"We want to have a plan of making him good at both study and work."
