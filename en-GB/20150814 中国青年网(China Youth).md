"As netizens, we are all connected, we share joys and sorrows.
Hoping for being kindly treated, one should be kind as well;
hoping for being warmly regarded, one should clear the darkness in the heart;
hoping for a cyberspace without violence, one should regulate the words first."
On 14th August, "Sunny Posting" was started at the Centre for Network Film & Television of CYLC(共青团中央网络影视中心), the "positive idols" TFBOYS attended the launching ceremony as Sunny Ambassadors, and initiated the appeal of rational commenting, civilised posting, and friendly reply on the web, for not to have mouse and keyboard overtake one's mind.

"Nowadays, the Internet has become our mutual spiritual home, the real society gets reflected, amplified, or even distorted here.
It is understandable that when seeing hateful people, you cannot help expressing furious anger;
when facing unfair situations, it is hard to avoid judging others pessimistically;
when stating personal views, you lose comprehension, tolerance, and respect of strangers on the web."
At the event, TFBOYS said, "over-exaggerating the dark veils the original colour in life, venting regardless of the consequences gathers the rage which will harm yourself one day.
Furthermore, complaining makes no one solve the real problems in action."

TFBOYS proposed that when the rage is overweighted, don't have mouse and keyboard overtake your mind.
Be more patient, compassionate, and confident on others, "for the present, and the future."

It is said that "Sunny Posting" is an action guided by Cyberspace Administration of China(国家互联网信息办公室) and CYLC, hosted by New Media Association of China Youth(中国青少年新媒体协会), calling for rational commenting, civilised posting, and friendly reply on the web, improving the environment of commenting and reply, setting up a serene Internet.
Over 30 news organisations, including people.cn(人民网), youth.cn(中国青年网), and Tencent, attended the event, promised to abide by "the seven bottom lines"(“七条底线”), perform social responsibilities, avoid biased direction in reports, and offer more reports and propagation on sunny(positive) events.

## Proposal for "Sunny Posting"

Nowadays, the Internet has become our mutual spiritual home, the real society gets reflected, amplified, or even distorted here.
It is understandable that when seeing hateful people, you cannot help expressing furious anger;
when facing unfair situations, you are hard to avoid judging others pessimistically;
when stating personal views, you lose comprehension, tolerance, and respect with strangers on the web.

However, have you given a thought that whether the world on the web is as real and complete as what you saw?
Are the words you posted what you would like to be seen by children?
Have you ever thought that over-exaggerating the dark veils the original colour in life, venting dissatisfaction regardless of the consequences gathers the rage which will harm yourself one day.
Furthermore, complaining makes no one solve the real problems in action.

I know that you understand that the society is not perfect, that many matters need time and patience.
But we do have the right path and confidence, we are witnessing the light and the bright future.

The web won't be dark once you are sunny.
The haze won't stay if you carry a breeze.
Only moving forward can we step over the barriers.
As netizens, we are all connected, we share joys and sorrows.
Hoping for being kindly treated, one should be kind as well;
hoping for being warmly regarded, one should clear the darkness in the heart;
hoping for a cyberspace without violence, one should regulate the words first.

Therefore, when the rage is overweighted, don't have mouse and keyboard overtake your mind.
When counter-current flows, be bold in rejecting the thoughts.
Be more patient, more compassionate, and more confident.
Be positive, rational, and civilised.
May we beautify our mutual spiritual home together.
For the present, and the future.
