*[Q - Question, K - WANG Jun-kai(Karry), R - WANG Yuan(Roy), J - YI Yang-qian-xi(Jackson)]*

**Q:**
Is there any interesting or memorable story during the debut as TFBOYS?
Please share some with our readers.

**K:**
There are many.
For example, when we went to Chengdu for the shoot of the MV of "Heart", we lived in the same room of the hotel.
It was boring at night, so we decided to tell the most horrible stories in our mind, but we were quite regretful in the end, because one of the stories happened exactly in hotel.
We were all scared, and slept in one bed that night.
WANG Yuan was so scared that Jackson and I had to go along with him to the wash room.

**R:**
My bronchitis was a little serious when we were preparing for the new album in the summer vacation, I often couldn't say anything.
I was very worried about slowing down the overall progress, as the schedule was tight.
I felt sorry for dragging behind, but Karry and Jackson were more worried about my throat, they kept telling me to sing less and rest more, giving warm water to me, mentioning on time about taking medicine.
I was very thankful of them. My condition was not bad in the formal recording, it finished well.
The two months of the summer vacation might be the most tired and toilsome period for us, we had to practise, make recordings and MVs from dawn till dark every day.
But none of us ever complained, we kept encouraging and helping each other, the time made our friendship stronger.

**J:**
In private, we did everything together.
The summer vacation was spent in the preparation for the album, we didn't have much time to play.
One day when finally had time to relax and play around, we had been photographed by fans accidentally.
But we were all absorbed in, didn't noticed this.
It was a staff who saw our photos the next day told us.

**Q:**
Different members of a group should have different personalities.
There must have many stories when you get together, which ones are you impressed with?

**K:**
We are quite different in personalities, but we get along very well, we are bosom buddies.
Roy is a little "silly" sometimes, but his good temper and nice character will never make others angry.
When he knows he's wrong, he is sensible of demanding an apology, so we rarely quarrel or ignore each other.
Jackson is shy in my first impression, and he loves his younger brother very much.
I was worried at first that we may not get along well, but he can also be very gambolling sometimes.
He likes to watch funny videos, share them with us, or even imitate the actions.
He can rival Roy in his "silly" actions.

**R:**
I think I'm the most talkative, and I often play tricks on them, so they like to kid me together once they have chance.
Take the shoot of "Heart" as an example, I would ride a bicycle in a scene, there were many NGs because the seat is a little taller, they joked on me and rides very fast aside;
when shooting in the swimming pool, they told the staff to give me a lifebelt, and said I couldn't swim;
in close-up shot, they were always making faces to make me laugh.

**J:**
We are different, but we get along very well.
I thought Roy was placid when we were not familiar, but he is very talkative in fact, and super optimism.
We consider him as "silly" sometimes, but it is he who make our group full of joy.
To Karry, he is our "elder brother", he's the eldest among us, and joined the earliest.
He's calm and has the manners of a leader, he often takes care of Roy and me all round.

---

**Q:**
Jackson, as the last one to join TFBOYS, do you remember the scene of seeing Karry and Roy for the first time?

**J:**
The first time I saw Karry and Roy in Chongqing, we didn't talk much, and I was deceived by Roy's "quietness".
To make us acquainted, a staff told us to show something, each of them sang a song, that's awesome in my opinion, it's totally another person holding the microphone.
They were better than me in singing, it made me much motivated in learning vocal music.
After that, we went for dinner.
It's my first time there, they cared about my appetite very much, asked if I can eat spicy, and what I like.
They also introduced some Chongqing cuisines, and kept serving food to me.
Later, we gradually became talky and acquainted.

**Q:**
Karry and Roy's cover of "Yige Xiang Xiatian, Yige Xiang Qiutian"(一个像夏天，一个像秋天, literally: "One Likes Summer, One Likes Autumn") had been reposted by many people,
is your relation in private like the lyrics -- "The first time we met, I was not pleased with you, never thought we could be so close"?
(Tell us your acquainting process.)

**K:**
I joined TF Family earlier than him -- I'm a senior :)
We didn't know each other well at first, because we were training in different places.
We became familiar from the cover of "Yige Xiang Xiatian, Yige Xiang Qiutian".
From that time, the teacher often made us train and cover together.
Besides, we are both fans of Jay Chou(周杰伦), this made us coming closer.
Roy is sometimes talkative, usually chattering and gabbling, which makes me bored at times.
But after getting used to it, I will feel strange instead if he is in quiet.
He's younger than me, I would take care of him in the training.

**R:**
I'm very different than him in characters, I'm talkative while he's not, this makes us complemented, and he's tolerant about me.
He gave me much help in singing, dancing, and study.
The dances in our new album was very knotty for me, I couldn't get a move to the point even after many practices, I was like a drag. Karry and Jackson weren't fed up a little, but helped me a lot.
They showed every move again and again, pointed out each of my faults.
I was very thankful of them.

**Q:**
The training and performances may be dull or busy.
What is your favourites in the spare time for regulation or relaxation or brushing up?

**J:**
As what other students do, like playing video games.
Karry plays LOL, but only average at it :)
We all know he loves animes, especially "One Piece".
Roy plays "QQ Speed"(QQ飞车, a multiplayer online racing game published by Tencent) in leisure time, that's a game played among pupils in Karry's and my opinion.
I play games on iPad.
And we all like listening to music for relaxation.

---

**Q:**
You debuted at very young ages, there must be many difficulties and challenges in the training.
Have you ever given up something, how did you overcome the difficulties?

**K:**
Roy faces more difficulties :)
He has to spend over three hours on the road in a training day, usually gets up at around 6 a.m., and arrives home after 8 p.m.
So does Jackson.
He lives in Beijing, has to come to Chongqing in holidays.
The living habit differs a lot, he has to be adapted, and endure the homesick.
As a Grade Three student of junior middle school, the heavy study burden is of the most challenging, I have little time to relax after study and training.
But we never ever thought about giving up, because music is our mutual dream, I believe that all of us can keep on.

---

**Q:**
You are group members on stage, close friends in life, your friendship is more touching than singing.
What is your comprehension of these two crucial things in life -- friendship and dream?

**R:**
To be frank, compared to dream, friendship is much closer.
I can see it, touch it -- it surrounds me all the time.
As to dream, it seems far away for us.
Everyone should have his dream, but only some people realized their dreams after persevering.
The most fortunate thing in our perseverance, I think, is the precious friendship.
What we can do now, is to treasure this friendship, to pursue the great dream.

---

**Q:**
As minors, as well as being popular idol singers, will it delay your school studies?
How do you balance the dream and the real life?

**R:**
It will more or less influence the study, because some performances were done during school time, and the training on weekend occupies revision time of learning.
Actually, we are just common students with music dream, it's different from those real stars.

**K:**
Dream is important to everyone, everyone has the right to pursue his dream.
But it has to be realized by every steady step.
At present, we should be good students on one hand, and train hard on the other hand, to pursue our dream with firm treads
-- like what the lyrics in our song "Mengxiang Qihang"(梦想起航, literally: "The Dream Sets Sail") says, "to pursue, never slow down".

**J:**
I think we are still in usual mind.
We are common students studying in common schools, there's nothing special, except we all love music.

---

**Q:**
As there are more and more fans of TFBOYS, will you be proud of having so many fans at this age?
Is there any impressive story with the fans?
What do you want to say to Clovers?

**R:**
I remember that in the shoot of the MV of "Heart", some fans were invited in.
Actually, it was the first time to see so many crazy fans, we felt quite happy.
The space was not large enough, which made it very hot.
A girl fell in a faint suddenly, and Karry ran over to lift her up.
Many people were moved about that.
To our fans, we'd like to say, "Thank you for your support and encouragement, we hope you can accompany us in the next ten years. Let's create our memories together."

**K:**
It's not a feeling of proud.
We are common students, except for studying both in school and on music.
The most impressive thing was the signing of our new album not long ago, many fans came, some from other cities.
We were greatly touched by their enthusiasm.
To our fans, I'd like to say, "Thank you for your support, you made us more determined on our chasing road.
We will keep fighting, live up to your expectation, and release more excellent works."

**J:**
Of the most impressive is the fan meeting held for the shoot of the MV of "Heart".
I was new at that time, many fans didn't know me.
I was worried about their attitudes, and was very nervous on that day.
In addition, that's the first time we met our fans, all of us were not sure about the number of attendees.
But I was amazed -- many people came, and they were zealous.
I was also surprised that many fans were holding boards with my name on, one of them kept encouraging me and telling me not to be nervous all the time aside.
It touched me very much.
I hope we can grow up with Clovers, fight for our dreams together.
I look forward to meet everyone and get Clovers' support in all the activities afterwards.

**Q:**
Your first EP "Heart Meng·Chufa"(Heart梦·出发, literally: "Heart, Dream Starts Off") won the first battle, tell us about your future plans.

**R:**
Karry and Jackson are in Grade Three of junior middle school, quite pressed for time, so the school study will be our primary task.
But if time permits, we'll release a new single in the winter vacation.
As to future plans, school study is the first, then our music dream.
I hope we can still be together after grown up, and have a place of us on the stage of music.
