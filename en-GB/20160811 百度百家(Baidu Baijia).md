“Hustle, hustle. Someone are fighting there.”

Two girls were grappling with each other, with strikes and kicks, surrounded by a flock of teenage girls carrying light boards with different colours and standing at a loss. One day before TFBOYS’ third anniversary, the fans outside the stadium waiting for the appearance of their idols after the rehearsal, broke into physical altercation in the scramble for a better position.

9:30 p.m., 5th August, 2016, 17 hours before the third anniversary fan meeting of TFBOYS, the war among the fans had already broken out. Physical altercation is only a visible tip of the iceberg in the war.

On 6th August, before dawn, the topic about this fans’ fight reached the front row of Sina Weibo hot topic chart. Fans of WANG Jun-kai (Karry) and of YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson), which were involved in the case, took actions to seek an explanation.

On 6th August, 2016, TFBOYS’ third anniversary fan meeting – “Trilogy” – started at 2:30 p.m. Nearly 10,000 fans from across the nation gathered together for the annual festivity.

“The clovers will blossom in the future. Now be the ocean of flowers of mine.” The meeting open with a song in the first E.P. of TFBOYS – “Start off For Love” (爱出发). [In fact, this is not the opening song.] While the name of the fans comes from the lyrics. On the stage, three little boys were showing their vigorous figures, but off the stage, the supporting war of fans were flowing in the dark.

In the auditorium, light boards in red, blue, and green mingled with one another, with several in orange sprinkled. Everyone familiar with the fans of TFBOYS knows that orange is the colour of the group, while blue, green, and red are of WANG Jun-kai (Karry), WANG Yuan (Roy), and YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson), respectively.

Nearly everyone of the about 10,000 fans in the stadium carried a board. Once the camera swept over the audience, they were triggered to hold up the banners or boards high in high spirits, with hoarse shouting, never got bored.

The fans of TFBOYS value light boards very much. In their cognition, light boards is tightly linked up with self-confidence.

![Image](http://d.hiphotos.baidu.com/news/w%3D638/sign=3f27f17811d8bc3ec60805c9ba8aa6c8/c9fcc3cec3fdfc03c1e3a7fadc3f8794a5c226dc.jpg)

If light boards are taken as a sign of invisible war, the squealing yells would be the best weapon throughout the meeting. When the three boys sing together, the calling of “TFBOYS”, “WANG Jun-kai” (Karry), “WANG Yuan” (Roy), and “YI Yang-qian-xi” (Jackson) happened to coincide. Though only mixed growls came out, no one flinched, everyone aimed at covering the different voices. When one of them were giving solo show, the fans of that boy would exert all their energies to shout the idol’s name out, while the fans of the other two made no sound at all, with eyes stared at their own phones, or changing batteries for the light boards. When another boy started to give his solo show, a totally different group of people began to yell.

“Group fans may be the most tired. They shout when anyone of the three is on stage.” An “only” fan said. The so-called “group fan” is the fan who fancies all three members of the group; while a someone-only fan is one who only fancies one of them. “Karry-only” fans, “Roy-only” fans, and “Jackson-only” fans are the fans who only fancy WANG Jun-kai (Karry), WANG Yuan (Roy), and YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson), respectively.

Obviously, this is a war of Four Kingdoms.

Besides the events off-line, the war of fans are spreading on-line. These days, different fan sects are working hard on the web: post with related topics and search related keywords deliberately on Weibo, refresh the pages of official solo videos to raise the hit numbers, and explore the highlights of the single idol in the anniversary meeting for promotion. Compared to the supporting war off-line, competition on-line costs less, but are fiercer and dirtier, filled with all kinds of voices.

Just yesterday, two products of malign competitions arise on Weibo hot topic chart. Some fan of the coupling of Karry and Roy made a video to slander Jackson, which made Jackson sect irritated. After the video was reported and deleted, the fans of the coupling of Karry and Roy launched the topic “yi shou zhe tian” [“易手遮天”, literally: to hide the truth from the masses. While “yi” is the surname of Jackson.] which accused that Jackson has strong backing. Jackson-only fans stroke back at once, pushed the topic “kai yuan minzhu hezhongguo” [“凯源民主合众国”, literally: united states of Karry and Roy.] to the hot topic chart.

The three years of TFBOYS are also the metamorphosis of the fan crowd. Group fans began with the largest territory, and are fading away with every passing day. Someone-only fans and coupling fans are thriving vigorously.

It is also the conflict between the fan sects that impulse the cohesion and the sense of identity of each sect, that generated precise organisation and great ability of mobilisation in each sect.

However, when the fans are coerced in the “war”, the supporting actions are no longer easy and joyous journeys of dream realisation, but intense moments of defending “the dignity of the idol”.

### Competition started one month before the meeting

The off-line battle for TFBOYS’ third anniversary fan meeting started as early as one month before the meeting.

On 1st July, Sina Weibo account of TFBOYS announced the third anniversary fan meeting in Beijing on 6th August. Quickly, fan sites of all sects started to draw up plans for the supporting. “ROYal-Knights” (王源骑士站) is among them.

The person in charge who accepted the interview is one of the six core members of “ROYal-Knights”. She has just graduated as a postgraduate, is the assistant of a regional leader of a national chain group, started fancying WANG Yuan (Roy) from September 2014. She told “yulezibenlun” [The Capital in Entertainment], the fan site started to plan the supporting for the anniversary as early as one month before the meeting, several members of the site finished the whole flow of designing props, contacting manufacturer, negotiating for sponsor, and arranging props.

[Calling for taking part in supporting events. Made by “ROYal-Knights”.]

At the same time, different fan sites were doing the same thing. But the preparation was often concealed as a secret – an early publication of the hole card might lead the site to a passive position. The designing, producing, and distributing of the supporting props, and even the promotion must be tightly chained in line, only well-managed process in every section can make the task completed.

A person who doesn’t adore an idol may not know what a “site” is. A “site” is a self-initiated organisation of fans with their idol, in various scales. Compared to a “scattered fan”, setting up or join a site will make a fan take himself/herself as a section in the career domain of the idol.

But with the inflating of the fans of TFBOYS, the case that fan sites take charge of the supporting is changing. Before 2016, in every event of TFBOYS, nearly all light boards were provided by fan sites. Before the event starts, a fan pays a deposit (mostly 100 yuan) to rent a light board and bring it in. This time, fan sites gave out purchase links on Taobao, a fan could buy the custom board directly. This may attract more “scattered fans” to join the supporting war. The supporting off-line becomes fiercer, “scattered fans” become a key power of the success.

What is worth mentioning, the crucial point of the battle is the ticket. Whether the sect can get more tickets for the battle, is the essential step of the supporting war. Only if the sect got enough tickets can it have enough seats, which means enough people and light boards. Only if the sect gathered more people together can it make the slogan louder than the others. The brightness of light boards and the loudness of slogan is the base of the fans’ self-confidence.

In the last anniversary, fan sects can buy group tickets. But this year, group tickets are cancelled, fans can only get tickets individually. How to gather fans in the same sect together, how to gather the certain colour together, become a troublesome matter for every sect. Finally, the solution is to mark off the seats, and to call for the attempt of buying tickets in a certain area. “It seems not bad. Fans can stay with the people of the same bias, there won’t be unnecessary conflicts.” A fan said.

Division of the seats of Jackson sect

Among the fans, [self-initiated] fan clubs and fan sites are much stronger than “scattered fans” in rallying, authority, and influence. Under their appealing, many fans will respond and spread actively. SHI Yin is a fan among them. It is the summer holiday of the third year in college for her, while she has adored YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson) for over two years. She got over 3,000 yuan last month as the salary of the internship, and allocated 1,280 yuan for trying to buy a ticket on the ground floor.

During this period, “dada” [pioneer(s)] of each fan sect have various tactics to ignite the fighting will of the fans, in order to grab more tickets. Often, it’s about the failure in the last years or the success of the other sects. This is called “fans-disheartening”, which is a common trick in every fan sect – let fans feel pity for their idol or other fan fellows, to hit the mark of cementing the people.

Over 11 o’clock, 25th July, SHI Yin was already nervous. “My palms were sweating, I was worrying if I can’t get it.” Recalling the panic buying, SHI Yin was still fluttering in the heart. The tickets would be released at 12:30, SHI Yin got her phone and computer ready before 12 o’clock, and kept sitting still before the screen. “I only stared at the time to countdown. My hands were shivering, and didn’t click at the right position at first. When I got access, tickets in my preferred area were already sold out. And the web was stumbling. I switched back at once and chose another area of Jackson sect.” The whole purchasing process lasted less than three minutes.

“That afternoon, the timeline on my Weibo was flooded with requesting for a ticket or seat change. Spectacular.” Area division in purchasing started to see the effect. SHI Yin said, to give YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson) better support, “dada” (opinion leaders) of Jackson sect set special Weibo group to gather the fans with tickets and discuss everything about the supporting. “I joined three groups, one is the general group in Beijing, the other two are in other districts. The Beijing group had over 900 people in.”

It was ten days before 6th August, all four Kingdoms were ready. On the other side, the preparations for the meeting in Guangzhou were about to finish.

### Before the meeting: Each sect shows special prowess

On 5th August, one day before TFBOYS’ third anniversary fan meeting, a person in charge in “ROYal-Knights” arrived at Beijing. Over 1 p.m., after placing the luggage in Yeahome International Hotel (悦宏国际酒店) at Wukesong (五棵松), she went to negotiate with a company about the promotion of the film “L.O.R.D” (爵迹) [a film Roy was in] without a stop.

That night, she and other members of “ROYal-Knights” were arranging gift bags for “scattered fans”. Besides glow sticks and head-boards, there were snacks, cards and rigid fans with Roy’s photos in the bags. When the hotel room was piled up with 118 bags, it was over 1 o’clock in the morning.

However, a flame of war broke the seeming harmonic. After midnight, the topic about the fans’ fight appeared on Weibo hot topic chart. Once it came out, operation accounts rushed in to spread the message. After all, negative news is easy to get attention. Without conclusion of right and wrong, WANG Jun-kai(Karry)’s fans and YI Yang-qian-xi(Jackson)’s fans were pushed to the forefront. Both sides launched attacks against each other, seized territory and suffered casualties.

In fact, all fan sects have the cognition that individual behaviour represents the whole group, the idol should finally pay for the fans’ actions. This is also tacit approval in commons. Essentially, this is the fallacy of composition. But being pressed by the vast environment, fans have to compromise. Therefore, they carry more about the words as a fan than the public, but it also makes them take their group consciousness as the target. This is exactly the same as any community in society. But in show biz, people get used to magnify the case, and to get amused from it.

Also in Yeahome International Hotel, at 8:15 a.m., 6th August, “Karry’s Barbaryam” (王俊凯的坝坝筵应援队) started to provide gift bags for fans in Karry sect. WANG Qiu, a member of the fan site, who works in Beijing and lives in Chaoyang District, got up at 5 a.m., and reached the east end of Beijing from the west end with props weighing about 35 kg. On the day, fan sites providing gift bags at Yeahome also included Karry’s “Mercury_Rainbow”, Roy’s “SecondToNone”, TFBOYS’ “TFB-FlowerSea” and site union, etc.

Fans getting gift bags in line

In fact, every fan sect was doing similar things – Preparing props, arranging gift bags, reserving fields, and even the fact that a member can only have one meal in a whole day. Usually, they post weibo before the day, and a fan can get a gift bag for free with a ticket and a certain light board. On one hand, it’s to encourage the fans to carry the custom board. One the other hand, it’s to strengthen the affiliation and cohesion of these fans via off-line community events.

Jackson’s fans got to the open space outside the stadium two days before the day. They cordoned a red line or marked a red sign to occupy the position. On 5th August, many red tents were already pitched by the stadium, while each tent was the base of a fan site. At night, to prevent from accidents, some fans would stay in tents overnight.

“Yulezibenlun” [The Capital in Entertainment] contacted “BeWithJackson” via private message on Weibo. The head of the site told us, they planned for the presentation outside the stadium from mid-July. The site planning and the renting of tents, tables, and chairs were made beforehand. Further, the managers of fan sites of Jackson sect are in one group for overall planning. “Planning means orderliness. People have surveyed which area is permitted for doing these. And the reserved positions have members guarding with a scheduling table. So, it’s normal to see a large area of red on 6th August. More payment results in better result. Jackson sect is tenacious, like our idol.”

On 6th August, red tents lined up outside the stadium, filled up several rows. Over 9 a.m., the crowd filled the area. Most of them were in red, with “1128” (the birthday of Jackson) marked on the back of the shirts. They were walking in knots, shuttling among booths, getting props they like or light boards they reserved. This scene was like visiting “miaohui” [庙会, temple fair]. In fan jargon, this is called “off-site supporting”. This time, Jackson sect won in the off-site supporting.

After the carnival, separating in stadium started.

Besides light boards for “scattered fans”, each fan site also prepared large-scale light banner which usually sizes 1-metre by 1-metre or 3-metre by 3-metre, to let their idol see his own name clearly. But these banners are not allowed to get access.

In order to take the banners in, fans often struggle and strive hard. A person in charge in “ROYal-Knights” told us, they made a light banner of 3-metre by 3-metre, reached the stadium two hours ahead of time. If the security check in an entrance doesn’t let it pass, then the next one. They tried nearly all the entrance. But the presentation of the banner also met twists and turns. “The limitation in the stadium is too strict. But to let WANG Yuan (Roy) see the green sea, and know there are many people who only support him, who only follow him, we made great efforts.” There were also many other sites and “scattered fans” trying to light their banners and show their support for WANG Yuan (Roy).

“BeWithJackson” was not lucky. The report of the supporting said the 3-metre by 3-metre wings were held by hand by four members, coping with the guards all the time. They also sacrificed their seats at lower floor and stayed at the top to exchange for the presentation. But when Qian-xi (Jackson) was taking his solo show, a guard pulled it down. Some member cannot refrain from tears. To avoid further trouble, she went to a washroom to criy.

![Image](http://d.hiphotos.baidu.com/news/w%3D638/sign=aeff709b3101213fcf334ddf6ce636f8/9825bc315c6034a87d30fcc3c3134954082376a5.jpg)  
The banner was removed when YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson) was taking his solo show.

WANG Yan(Roy)’s fans exerted all efforts for the supporting. A person in charge in “ROYal-Knights” said, “for this meeting, we specially ordered 1108 glow sticks, and 10 reflective flags. And light boards, a light banner, and gift bags were appended. Since they were all custom, the price was not low at all.” It is known that the expense of supporting for birthday is often higher than for such a meeting. Fans “stake thousands of taels of gold at one throw”, only for promoting WANG Yuan (Roy) to more people. But she revealed that the money spent for the last birthday is much more.

The battle of the supporting of birthdays last year was quite a large one in the three years. As their birthdays are 21st September, 8th November, and 28th November – the intervals are narrow, whose birthday had splashed more water was certain to be compared among fans, media, and the public. Besides the commonly used ads on bus body and in malls, every fan sect planned dozens of events: Karry sect booked a whole amusement park for fan’s carnival; Roy sect planned exclusive VIP waiting room and boarding pass in an airport, and an ad on Times Square of New York; Jackson sect provided global trip for YI Yang-qian-xi (Jackson).

For example, on WANG Yuan(Roy)’s 15th birthday last year, fans made over forty events, including ads over 20 LED billboards – one of them is the largest LED board in Asia, which sits in Chongqing, is 125 metres tall. (It’s said that the price is 30,000 yuan per 5 minutes.) Roy’s fans showed the ad for three days. They also made ads on the LED board on Times Square. Even the boarding pass of Chongqing airport had changed with WANG Yuan(Roy)’s photo on it. A fan of WANG Yuan (Roy) told us, they also ran a 15-second ad in a hot talk show in Chongqing TV, which played during the week of WANG Yuan(Roy)’s birthday. She also expressed the reluctance of referring the price, as the good will is the most important.

When asked whether it is worthy of putting all those money and efforts into the supporting, fans in every sect said “yes”, “things we give him can never lag behind others”. This is also the straight concept of “BeWithJackson”.

In the Kingdoms of TFBOYS’ fans, all competitions are derived from love. This kind of love is sometimes too doughty and seems very irrational. But in their eyes, they haven’t done enough.

### War of Fancraft: From Clover Empire to Warring States

From being in vogue, with the development of the group, the fans of TFBOYS experienced continuous iterative changes, the structure is becoming lucid:

![Image](http://f.hiphotos.baidu.com/news/w%3D638/sign=dfd7a07bbbde9c82a665fa8c548080d2/d000baa1cd11728b0a9fc860c0fcc3cec2fd2cc5.jpg)  
**Influence change of the fans of TFBOYS**  
Group fans  
↓ Split  
Coupling fans of Karry and Roy, Karry-biased fans, Roy-biased fans, Jackson-biased fans, Karry-only fans, Roy-only fans, Jackson-only fans, Group fans  
↓ Purify  
Karry-only fans, Roy-only fans, Jackson-only fans, Group fans  
↓  
?

From Clover Empire in the beginning to Warring States at present, the great change happened in less than three years. SHI Yin witnessed the turning. She started fancy the group from Yinyue Music Awards in 2014, gradually became Jackson-biased, and finally froze as Jackson-only. She had deep feelings on it: “I may have witnessed the fading of an era and the rising of another one.”

From the debut of the group, fans experienced all kinds of turbulence and wars. Fans from different sects often assault each other on Sina Weibo, Baidu Tieba [Baidu Post], or other BBS sites, and turn the battlefields upside down. Because of these wars, fans of TFBOYS formed the current stable structure. Fans’ preferences are purified, styles of fan sects set up gradually.

Sometimes, SHI Yin missed the atmosphere when she first came in, when all fans promoting and voting overnight to send TFBOYS to one stage and another, when biased fans were kind for the other boys. A group fan who has left said, “that community which may absorbing newcomers has gone, the malformed state at present is unable to alter, only keeping away can a person maintain the initial heart.”

About the third anniversary fan meeting, she worried about the three boys of TFBOYS more than the fans. “The agency is more and more commercialized on them. The popularity is excessively exerted, with no satisfying music work. I sincerely hope the three boys could have time to have a rest, adjust the mental state, and think seriously about the way in the future, follow the thought in the heart, be brave to express true thoughts. Don’t conceal or deliberately change oneself under the outer pressure.”

![Image](http://e.hiphotos.baidu.com/news/w%3D638/sign=25064873293fb80e0cd162d40ed02ffb/bd315c6034a85edfa95eba6141540923dc5475a5.jpg)

After the third anniversary, we contacted with some “only” fans who were once group fans. They all agreed that every people is biased, when facing three teenagers totally different in personality and charm, no one can treat equally. WANG Qiu, a member of “Karry’s Barbaryam”, explained from human nature, that “human beings are egocentric and exclusive, this is the human nature. If you care about someone, you will do everything you can to help him in troubles. When a matter is about human nature, there’s nothing right or wrong, but cause and effect. But the affections and energy of a person is limited, when the favour of someone makes the balance tilt too much, being equal is not as good as following your heart.” On the surface, it is sure that someone-only fans are increasing and dominating, while group fans are reducing.  
*[Translator: The above statement is obviously justifying selfishness, quibbling for binary opposition, and concealing genuine causation of conflicts.]*

“In fact, it is the agency who set the personal supporting colours. There’s no other people to blame.” Some fan told us.

Why do fans value the supporting so much? Roy-only fan, TIAN Xin, said, “it is to let WANG Yuan (Roy) feel that we support him anywhere and anytime.” Karry-only fan, WANG Qiu, said, “when there’s a person you cherish very much, you would try your best to guard him, want to give him the best you can.” Jackson-only fan, SHI Yin, said, “he deserves.”

In short, the competition is not the original purpose, but the consequence each sect has to face.

WANG Qiu takes the competition as a natural phenomenon, “it’s hard to avoid being compared in a group. It’s common for fans to compete for the benefit of their own idols. Actually, outside the community of fans, competition is everywhere in real life. All the people struggling in different social status follow the principle that ‘the fittest survives in natural selection’, problems in social life may also appear in the community of fans. Some are extreme, while some others are sober. Isn’t the human society progressing in such dynamic equilibrium? In my personal view, being a fan is the same as being a common people, one should not be extreme.”  
*[Translator: This statement is also concealing genuine causation of conflicts.]*

This Saturday, TFBOYS’ fan meeting will come to Guangzhou. What will the situation be like there? Will they keep yelling different names and slogans –

“From the start to the future, only for WANG Jun-kai”

“Love only for WANG Yuan”

“One heart for YI Yang-qian-xi”

“TFBOYS, walk along the way together”
