In the morning of 31st August, before the opening ceremony of Meixihu High School, the principal PENG Rong-hong(彭荣宏) announced with a loudspeaker -- no surround, no scream, no sign.

That's because TFBOYS YI Yang-qian-xi would make a speech at the ceremony as the delegate of new students of Grade 1.
The star was speaking on the dais in the school uniform, some students were feeling that "the ceremony is like a mini fan meeting".
While at the same time, his fans were concerned about YI's accent, "As Changsha dialect is so infectious, will he switch to it in three years?"

**In school**  
**Precautions made beforehand**

"He was reading draft, earnest and bashful, not in a sense of star."
A new student said, after the ceremony, YI was immediately surrounded, many students and teachers wanted to take photos with him, "and he's smiling, didn't refuse them."
And there's an adult following, "maybe a bodyguard, but not fearful."

Mr. PENG said, to prevent the interruption of the campus order and the congestion in campus, the security guards received extra training that "no outsiders can pass".
On the day, some fans came with excuses of visiting students or teachers, they were all kept out of the school.
As a lot of people would gather at the ceremony, Mr. PENG also requested for police force from local police station.

The school was very cautious at the coming of the star.
Before the ceremony, Mr. PENG emphasised "the three noes", and refused all journalists.

On the day, YI Yang-qian-xi posted his photos in campus on Weibo.

**Schoolmates**  
**Will the school be a scenic spot?**

A new student said, he knew the news long before.
"In the summer camp in July, a teacher said a star will come, then we guessed it must be YI Yang-qian-xi, so it's not a big surprise to meet him."

This student said, he'd listened to TFBOYS' songs, "they are popular, many girls like them."
As a boy, he felt as usual, "he's quite bashful, wearing the school uniform like others."
And he said that many girls talked about this, "but just about which class he's in, they didn't went to see him specially."

In his opinion, the star brought much concern about the school, "over 100 fans waited outside when the ceremony's under way, our school may be a scenic spot in Changsha."

**Fans**  
**Concerned about the dialect**

YI's fans cared much. A fan wished YI make good friends here, "and people around don't besiege him".
Some others wished he has a fine learning environment, "because these three years are critical, as he has a high goal, I wish he could study in peace."

Interestingly, due to his coming to Changsha, fans concerned about his accent the most.
"He speaks a very standard accent, but the Changsha dialect is so infectious that I'm easily affected by the programmes of Hunan TV.
Will he switch to the dialect in three years?"

**First impression from principal**  
**Restrained and polite**

Mr. PENG said, he thought that YI would be hard to be subjected to discipline, but changed his view once he saw him, "he's very restrained, and very polite."

It is said that YI is a "xue ba"[学霸, one who's score ranks top in class or school], and Mr. PENG said that his test scores are fairly good.
The performances took much time, but he had extra lessons to catch up, and made great efforts, so he's always among the top in junior middle school.

Mr. PENG said, during the school art festival this December, YI will give a show.
Though not sure whether it's personal or of the group [In my opinion, it's definitely impossible for the group to come.], it must bring the air hot to the top.

"I wish people don't take him(YI Yang-qian-xi) as a star, and our school a 'panda'.
In our eyes, he's a common student who come for his study, and attend the College Entrance Examination in three years, like any other one.
And we respect his choice, provide convenience for his work, that he can be absent for performances and take extra lessons afterwards.
I believe that he can balance the study and the work, and take a way of his own."
-- PENG Rong-hong
