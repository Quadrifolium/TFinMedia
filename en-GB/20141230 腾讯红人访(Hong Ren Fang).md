Three boys under fifteen were pushed to the dazzling limelight far before they know the rules.
They have a "ten-year promise" with fans, but it's hard for them even to imagine the scene when they are twenty, only know that they will be more -- handsome!

Voices of frolic on the corridor of the hotel came closer.
With a "bang", a door was bumped open, three boys dashed in the room
-- WANG Yuan was the first, followed by YI Yang-qian-xi and WANG Jun-kai.
They are better known as "TFBOYS".

"Why? The computer's not on. Who turned it off?"
WANG Yuan shook the mouse while gasping, with a little temper on the face.

The long waiting photographer apologised that he closed the computer when testing his equipment.

"No, it almost finished downloading."
The boy complained without seeing him.

"Downloading what?"

WANG Yuan didn't respond, WANG Jun-kai standing aside told him, "his game."

"Well, well, not a big deal at all. Don't be childish."
A staff not much elder of the agency tabbed his shoulder with a smile.
WANG Yuan seemed to have forgotten it, turned on smile and said,
"I'm hungry, I want that McDonald's Spicy McWings."

It's hard to link the playful boys in the front with the image the media figured before.
In most reports, they were described as "well-behaved", "tired but still smiled sweetly", "received interview on their feet all along", greeting journalists warmly, and full of thankful and determination in their answers.

"They are now familiar with all these, and become 'slick'."
A journalist who have met them several times stated.

But too humble and obedient or too forthright and sincere is not the way of survival in show biz.
The delicate balance between them is a required course for every star.

It's obvious that the three boys under fifteen were pushed to the dazzling limelight far before they know the rules of the "vanity fair".
Take the data as a proof, in the past half year, the average search index of the keyword "TFBOYS" on Baidu was 133,327, which was three times of "ZHOU Jie-lun"(Jay Chou, 周杰伦), or a little lower than "YANG Mi"(杨幂), while the keyword didn't appear one and a half years ago.

## An Accidental Popularity

On 6th Aug., 2013, TFBOYS debuted. There's no conference, no press release, a 3'49'' video clip named "Ten Years"(十年) was all they gave out.

On 4th Oct., the group held an fan meeting about the first E.P. "Heart Meng·Chufa"(Heart梦·出发, literally: "Heart, Dream Starts Off") in a mall of Chongqing Sun Moon Light Square(重庆日月光中心广场).
Nearly a thousand fans came, though there's even no seat on the site.
They sat on the ground, waving balloons of all colours, screamed loudly when the boys came out.
The queue waiting for signs started from the first floor to the fifth.
[Incorrect description. The crowd upstairs were not for the signing.]

It's just two months after the debut, they were an illustration of "rising to fame overnight".
When talking about the feeling then, WANG Jun-kai said he's "very pleasant, very surprised, very happy, and very impressed.
I hadn't thought that there were so many people who like us."

Actually, their path to fame was accumulated with a series of accidents.

In 2010, WANG Jun-kai was in Grade Five of Panlong Primary School of Chongqing.
Like his peers, he lived among classroom, school playground, and home, likes Jay Chou, wanted to be a pilot.
He thought "being a star is unreal".
Therefore, he left a wrong phone number when been found at school by a scout.
"How clever I am! Haha!" He told us.

WANG Yuan was in Dajiang Primary School, about nineteen kilometres to the south of Panlong.
He was trained in folk songs, dreamed of becoming a folk singer like WANG Hong-wei(王宏伟) and SONG Zu-ying(宋祖英).
"I was not longing at being a star," he explained, "many people kept saying how nice they sang, so I ..."

YI Yang-qian-xi is the one who wanted to be a star.

"You started attending talent shows from seven?"
Our journalist asked.

"From five."
The boy corrected.

In 2009, nine-year-old YI and two other boys under eight formed "Fei Xuan Shaonian"(飞炫少年), had performed on CCTV and Satellite TV Channels as the "youngest idol group".
This attempt, like all those before, failed at last.

If it were not Time Fengjun, these boys may never met.

In Aug. 2009, Beijing Time Fengjun was found, and set its base in Chongqing.
Chongqing and nearby Sichuan is teem with audition stars, one can easily find candidates from Chongqing and Sichuan in all kinds of talent shows.
From 2010, Time Fengjun started posting on the web and giving out leaflets round schools, to recruit "8- to 12-year-old boys, with positive appearance, well-developed figure, have ambition of developing in arts or entertainment."

Time Fengjun didn't cover its ambition of being the China's Johnny's.
Johnny & Associates, found in 1975, is regarded as the "greatest DreamWorks for boys in Asia".
It recruits boys aged ten to fourteen and trains them, pack them up as a group some years later.
In forty years, it almost monopolised the market of male entertainers in Japan -- national idols like Kimura Takuya, Takizawa Hideaki, and Kamenashi Kazuya are all "made in Johnny's".

After losing contact with WANG Jun-kai for some time, Time Fengjun got in touch with his parents at last, and persuaded them to let the boy join the first trainees of "TF Family".
One year later, they drove to WANG Yuan's home, and made his parents agree with his training.

The two boys wasn't aware of the fresh-new door in their lives.
WANG Jun-kai came here for "getting a skill" -- he hadn't touched guitar before.
WANG Yuan took himself as "silly" -- "Training for free, I must come."
Recalling their first meeting, WANG Jun-kai imitated WANG Yuan's words in Chongqing dialect with a smile.

Their manager Yuna thought, it's this usual mind that made them persist in.
Not all boys can endure the loneliness before debut.
Although the training is totally free, and the agency subsidizes 500 yuan per month, many people quitted for hopelessness.

After the expiration of contracts, the first nine trainees except WANG Jun-kai left.
In every weekend and holiday, WANG Jun-kai gets up at six, takes a bus for nearly two hours to the agency, starts lessons on vocal music, dance, and guitar from nine, goes back home by bus after five P.M.
"I stayed because I was naïve," he said, "I just thought that as long as I keep training, I will make it the best."

Time Fengjun was prepared to long-term investment.
The trainees performed bland, WANG Jun-kai had even been pointed out of being out of tune when he attended "Up! Juniors"(向上吧！少年) of Hunan TV in 2012.
"They are lack of strengths, and are immature. This will be a long process.
We are not aimed at making child stars, but super stars of the future." Yuna said.
Hence, the agency decided to make them debut after grown-up, and waited for their growth very patiently.

An accident disturbed this plan.
In June 2013, The cover video of "Yangcong"(洋葱, Onion) by WANG Jun-kai, WANG Yuan, and drummer WANG Yi-feng(王译锋) was reposted by Ashin(阿信) of MayDay.
The MV got over 30 million hits in several days, was broadcast on CTi TV(中天電視, Chung T'ien Television) of Taiwan.
This sudden great success prompted the boss of the agency to think "it is the time".

He found a partner for WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan -- YI Yang-qian-xi, who was in Grade One of Affiliated Senior Middle School of BUCT(北京化工大学, Beijing University of Chemical Technology).
This was another coincidence -- YI attended "Up! Juniors" at the same time with WANG Jun-kai, was noticed by the boss in his skilled dance and school study.
[Unconfirmed. The performance in school may not be what concerned in this period.]

At this time, the line-up was done. Journalist SUN Xiang(孙翔) took them as "Xiao Hu Dui"(小虎队, Little Tigers) twenty years ago -- one for his charming, one cute, and one dynamic.
"WANG Jun-kai is like Nicky Wu(吴奇隆), handsome and cool, attracts those who like hard-core idols.
WANG Yuan is like Alec Su(苏有朋), cute, warm, and talkative, attracts girl fans and mum fans.
YI Yang-qian-xi debuted directly without being a trainee, he is like Julian Chen(陈志朋), outstanding in dance and school study, arouses adoration in the heart of fans.
Such a solid triangle covers the favourites of the mainstream of fans."

Two months later, TFBOYS debuted. In the following year, the boys became "super stars" rapidly
-- they gained 6 million fans, won the most popular singer award, attended in the top variety show in China, endorsed ads with promotion fee of 200 million yuan[not endorsement fee], the MV of "Magic Castle" broke the hit record kept by "Zui Xuan Minzu Feng"(最炫民族风, literally: "The Most Dazzling Folk Style") for years.

What a sigh that the cover of "Yangcong" what fans treated as "changing TFBOYS's fate", was initially aimed at "finding mother" of WANG Yi-feng.
At present, WANG Yi-feng is still a common trainee of TF Family.
Yuna didn't say much except "he met his mother after that", with the reason that "it's inconvenient to talk about trainees who is not debuted yet".

![Image](http://img1.gtimg.com/ninja/0/ninja141992752454815.jpg)  
On 21st Sept., TFBOYS's fans celebrated WANG Jun-kai's birthday using the LED screen outside Sheraton Chongqing Hotel(重庆喜来登大酒店).

## A Cautious Gambling

To some degree, what WANG Yi-feng encountered is inevitable -- training idol is a gambling, countless failures stack the few's success.
Even the so-called "no failure" Johnny & Associates can only push out one group in two to three years, while at the same time, it recruits as many as 200 trainees every year.

Time Fengjun was very clear about that.
Therefore, it called as many suited boys as it can, set tests and exams, bet all its hope on those who passed the assessments.
And the judgement was straightforward -- popularity.

The knock-out match starts before one enters the agency.
During the three months' probation, the boys' training videos and photos would be published on Weibo, BBSes, and Baidu Tieba.
The page views, the click rates, the number of followers, and the netizens' comments decide directly whether they pass the test and be a formal trainee.

Compared to the traditional star-making process, this "cultivation mode" is a more cautious gambling.
It greatly avoids the risk of "pouring in all efforts but gaining nothing", because the ingratiation is set to the earliest stage
-- those favourite ones are cultivated, those been worshipped will certainly be popular.

TFBOYS is the chosen one.

In early photos, WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan didn't catch one's eyes, sometimes they sat at the end.
During this time, TF Family released several songs, but didn't receive much response.
Until early 2012, WANG Jun-kai's cover of "Qiu Niao"(囚鸟, literally: "A Bird In Cage") was pushed to the homepage of Youku.com, his cover of "Yige Xiang Xiatian, Yige Xiang Qiutian"(一个像夏天，一个像秋天, literally: "One Likes Summer, One Likes Autumn") with WANG Yuan had been reposted by the original singer Christine Fan(范玮琪), did they received a period of concern.

Time Fengjun started to bet on the two boys.
Though shot all its videos with its own staff and a simple camera, this time it invited a famous MV director in Chongqing -- HUANG Tun(黄墩).
HUANG made the first formal cover video "Dang Ai Yi Cheng Wangshi"(当爱已成往事, literally: "When Love Becomes the Past") for WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan.
The video had been played on mobile TV of Chongqing, and promoted in QQ pop-up window.
A fan said she first know the two boys through the pop-up window.
The second work of HUANG Tun is "Yangcong", which prompted their early debut.

Nowadays, where TFBOYS comes, there fans gather.

## Self-written Rules

Debut doesn't mean maturity -- this is another character of "cultivation mode".

As three boys young in age, plain in singing, not superior in looks, how did they get popular?
The reason may be found from the nickname of the fans, "Clovers".
The name comes from the lyrics of the song "HEART"
-- "Clovers will blossom in the future, now just be the ocean of flowers of mine."
While clover is also a symbol of luck.
A deeper meaning is -- the three of TFBOYS represent three leaves, the fans are the fourth leaf that grows with them together.

"Participation" and "sense of growing" is the secret recipe of the "cultivation mode".
Time Fengjun completely referenced the experience of Johnny & Associates.
From the very first day the boys entered the agency, a camera keeps recording their training, rest, dining, and attendance in shows.
Besides for testing the responses on the web, these are the valuable materials after their debut.
"Watching the idol's immature actions when he first comes, comparing to his shiny performances on the concert in his twenties, it greatly arouses the empathy of being growing together." SUN Xiang said.

The agency registered Weibo accounts and Baidu Tieba accounts for all the trainees, let them share their lives with fans.
The follower of Weibo accounts of WANG Jun-kai, WANG Yuan, and YI Yang-qian-xi all exceeded one million, each post they write can easily get over 200,000 reposts and comments.
The "participation" reached a top in 7th June, 2014, when WANG Jun-kai was preparing his entrance examination, the fans commented over 400,000 times under his post, helping to summarize the knowledge points.
Someone called it "a textbook in 140 characters".

The boys didn't know they are in "The Truman Show".
They are like Truman in the film, live in their own world without much thought.
In most of the time, they are students, they will have snacks with friends as usual.
In the show biz where everyone masks him/herself, they don't play with the "rules".

When asked how they comprehended the emotions of the song "Dang Ai Yi Cheng Wangshi", WANG Jun-kai said he "expressed with his experience of farewell with classmates in primary school",
while WANG Yuan said directly that he "pretended -- imitated the original, pretended to be understood, though actually didn't understand at all".

Such performances are not the agency's fault.
In fact, Time Fengjun is setting up its own rules -- "being real".
"They are different from gorgeous-like idol groups in Japan and Korea, they are the boys next door, they are what the boys at that age are." Yuna said.

The realness won many fans.
The words of "pretend" made a college girl "touched by their purity and sincerity" indeed.

Even the crude scenes of early MVs were accepted by fans.
They joked at the lack of professional recording equipment and cameramen, at the subsidisation from the director in MV shooting, at the unsuitable inexpensive clothes the boys wore, at the poor taste of the decoration of the room.
SUN Xiang even found a mop in a scene.

However, the boss of Time Fengjun is also a respected person in Beijing real estate circle.
In early years, the agency didn't avoid mentioning about its background, a staff had said in an interview that,
"training agencies lacking economic strengths are usually dragged down.
This is an opportunity for us on the contrary."
It means that Time Fengjun may not be as poor as been seen.

This agency had no one ever worked in the circle, but it opened up a path to success which itself may be surprised.
Mr. L, a practitioner in music industry, said,
"they didn't have plenty resources, large amount of money, grand visual effects, fine music arranging, advanced producing team, or even promotion channels.
They just uploaded videos on the Web, and many fans gathered in. Why can they achieve all these while other practised agencies have to pour in a lot of people and money?
The price-performance ratios differ enormously.
Rather than being shocked, all practitioners should rethink the matter."

Internet created a chance to the low cost, high return attempt.
Yuna said, "We have to use the new media. They are unlike adult stars, they have to study in school, don't have time to attend traditional media activities.
To maintain the exposure to the public, we make short plays and shows in weekends, upload on websites, to get the fans' concern and interaction."

There's also a staff collecting the fans' comments, to adjust the boys' costumes and shapes.
"Does it sound familiar?
Right, that's the mode how Xiaomi made its MIUI.
It's like Internet thinking."
"meow wang", a fan in high-tech industry, said.

The fans were complaining about this "poor agency once nearly closed down", while caring much about these "boys with ambitious dream".
"If the agency were not so unprofessional, the fans won't be so powerful, the potency won't be so strong."
A fan Jenny had told the media.

On 15th Apr., 2014, after countless "Clovers" continuously replaying, liking, commenting, and downloading the MV, TFBOYS stood on the stage of Yinyue V-Chart Award Ceremony and received "The Most Popular Singer in Mainland China" award from the largest music video website.
A fan Reka wrote, "We did all these just for seeing your smiles, we won't make you fail because we know you don't like to lose.
We will raise you to higher and larger stages, to see you shining, becoming real idols."

TFBOYS is not positioned as idol stars, but the boys next door.

## Atypical Idols

Time Fengjun clearly knows what makes them attract.
Musican ZOU Xiao-ying(邹小樱) had said in a report that after TFBOYS debuted, Time Fengjun had asked her for promoting the song "Heart",
"I didn't take it seriously, just as a favour, promoted on music sites like 163 Music and Baidu Music."
It's some time later did she know that the MV of the song had topped on the chart of Yinyuetai, but "as the champion of the chart, they didn't have any other platform like Baidu or 163.com."
She concluded, "It's precisely positioned -- only videos are the best media for showing the young looks."

According to a survey by Sina Entertainment, 90% of TFBOYS's fans are female, they are mostly 1980s and 1990s.
They created two phenomenal concepts -- "sister fans" and "mum fans".

To some viewpoints, TFBOYS seized the climate of "yaoi fandom culture".

A "sister fan" said, the success of the cover of "Yige Xiang Xiatian, Yige Xiang Qiutian" prompted the agency of "being aware of the operation of shipping",
while the following cover of "Dang Ai Yi Cheng Wangshi" "maximized the good-looking and cute of WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan, and the shipping between them.
It's a metaphor of their affection," which captured some yaoi fandom successfully.

In Feb. 2014, the self-made drama "Study Room in Boys' School" was linked to "danmaku"(弹幕, overlaid comments on a video, derived from Japanese "弾幕") video site bilibili.com.
Each episode was released on Friday, WANG Yuan and WANG Jun-kai were the main actor.(YI Yang-qian-xi was absent because he's in Beijing.)
"The script was puerile, the performances were poor, but the story intended to show some vague shipping between them.
Then it caused a sensation." SUN Xiang said.

But there's no doubt that the search index of TFBOYS exploded from that time.
The yaoi fandom expressed their illusion of the handsome boys in overlaid comments, called themselves "Kai-Yuan gangs", and later became fans of "the three kiddy".
Backed by these "sisters" and "mums", the three boys once hot in a small circle stepped into the public's eyes.

After that, they were rapidly crowned with "The Most Popular Singer in Mainland China", invited to the top variety show "Happy Camp"(快乐大本营), sang the theme song of the film "No Zuo No Die"(我就是我, literally: "I Am Who I Am"), endorsed BBK e-tutor, ascended the throne of national idols.

Nowadays, there are 77,500 items about "TFBOYS" on Taobao, from the same pattern of WANG Yuan's hat and YI Yang-qian-xi's sweater to pillows, cups, and school-bags with their photos.
There's even a clover-shaped watch tagged "TFBOYS watch".
In its official Taobao shop, over 30,000 sets of "2015 TFBOYS Official Fruit Theme Desk Calendar" were sold in 20 days at 49 yuan.

ZHANG Zi-yi(章子怡) nominated them in the Ice Bucket Challenge, ZHANG Jie(张杰) showed his praise in public, YANG Mi told WANG Jun-kai to "be in love a bit later", CHEN He(陈赫) had made a post scoffing himself -- "At the airport, there's TFBOYS, and a 'has-been' comedian."
In the picture, he's drinking coffee against a dust bin, with a crowd of fans picking up TFBOYS in the back.

Commenter Hen-hen-hong thought TFBOYS is a subtle entity to adult idols, they didn't know much about the "vanity fair".
Differing from adult stars fighting in strengths, the presence of these "cultivated" teenagers are for being inspected and produce illusions.
Hence, they have no threat to the world of adult stars. Being innocent, pure, natural, and hugely popular, those who don't know them are seemed out.
Thus, "Mentioning TFBOYS is like saying 'excavating technique'[a meme on Chinese social networks] in a sentence, which becomes a sign to show that one's keeping up with trends."

Out of the same reason, she considered musician LIANG Huan(梁欢) excessive on the issue of TFBOYS's live shows.
"The focus of three 'zheng tai'(正太, means cute pre-adolescent boys, derived from Japanese word "shota", but differs from its English meanings) is never 'endowed with both looks and voices'.
The meaning of their singing, music albums, variety shows, and performances is to provide a kind of product for purchasing, not to prove their strengths."

The care for the boys from "mum fans" confused adults accustomed to "overdosed fans".
Such as a fan Shang-tu-ling, she commented LIANG Huan's post, "after watching the last episode of 'TF Teens GO! 2', I come here to say something.
Thank you, the sons' live show is much related to your effort.
To us old aunties for music, it's the greatest happiness to see Kai-Yuan singing well.
Thank you very much."
*[What these sentences are saying confuses me.]*

## An Unknown Promise

At the first public activity at Chongqing S.M.L. Square, TFBOYS was surrounded by countless "sister fans" and "mum fans" for the first time.
But Yuna said, "We are somewhat surprised at these fans."

When TFBOYS visited the studio of "Kangsi Coming"(康熙来了, a talk show in Taiwan), the emcee Kevin Tsai(蔡康永) asked, "are your audiences little girls?"
Their initial target were indeed little girls.
In the MV of their first album, they were singing "the taste of candy and your lips, I want to know" to a girl.

XU Ruo-feng(徐若风), who wrote the lyrics of "Jiewu Shaonian"(街舞少年, literally: "Hip-hop Teenagers") and "Heart", had said that Time Fengjun was very strict to the words, forced him to "modify again and again".
Yuna admitted that the lyrics have some misdirecting, "it gives boys and girls in adolescence some imagination."
But she expressed that there won't be such words in TFBOYS's songs, "due to the change of the composition of fans, we are adjusting the direction accordingly.
Like in music, it should be not too childish for 'mum fans', not too mature for little girls, and different from adult entertainers.
It should be suitable for their age."

Nowadays, Time Fengjun aimed at making TFBOYS "Chinese-characterized teen idols" with compassion, ideals, diligence in study, and positive energy.
For this purpose, they attended many activities on public weal, and accepted endorsements carefully.
YI Yang-qian-xi, who will take the entrance examination in a few months, is going to suspend his performances "like WANG Jun-kai in the last year, focus on study."
YI looked at WANG when saying, and WANG tabbed him on the shoulder.

In the break between interviews, an assistant borrowed a camera to take some short videos.
The three boys were quite familiar with the speech "hello, everybody from **.com, we are TFBOYS."
Their smile remained in the following calling for "combating with Ebola".
"This is a clip for public weal, don't smile," the assistant mentioned.
After four NGs, the shoot was finally finished.

Even though Time Fengjun were extremely scrupulous, there came criticisms.
In Oct. 2014, it was rumoured that TFBOYS was "blocked" by relevant department due to "the harmful example of teenagers".
Though ended up with nothing, it is still a topic the agent doesn't want to mention.

Coincidentally, at almost the same time, they starred in an advertisement for an e-tutor.
"Ideal and study can be accomplished both.
Many people see us as doing wrong, but we are chasing our dream when others are playing."
The words are like their confession towards the doubts.

"Dream" is the most important keyword of TFBOYS, the secret recipe of winning fans.
In the video when they debuted, TFBOYS touched many "Clovers" with a ten-year "promise of dream" --

"If you can look ten years forward, what do you wish you would be?  
If you can look ten years back, what do you wish you were doing?  
If there lies a short-cut to the dream, that path must be persistence.  
If I insist on chasing from eight, when I'm eighteen, wouldn't I possess ten years persistence?  
No matter from eight to eighteen, or from eighteen to twenty-eight, we have ten years to go.  
Even if failed, we will be closer to the dream."

When saying these words, WANG Jun-kai was fourteen, WANG Yuan and YI Yang-qian-xi were thirteen.

"What is your dream?
To be specific, what do you want to be like when you are twenty?"
Our journalist asked.

Being absent for a while, the three boys elbowed each other to response.
WANG Jun-kai answered first, "When I'm twenty, I'll be a man ... maturer, and more ... handsome!"
He smiled, and passed the microphone to WANG Yuan.

"When I'm twenty, I may be ... will be very handsome."
WANG Yuan was hesitating at first, then said loud and clear,
"yes, more handsome, and more knowledgeable and learned."

YI Yang-qian-xi said the longest.
"I think all of us will be strengthened, in many aspects.
Not like what we are at present... er, not very mature.
Our strengths will be advanced, we will be a group much better."
"What about yourself?"

He thought a few seconds, "be the best in my heart, and be taller."

The bags and clothes TFBOYS have are soon the "hot patterns" on Taobao.

Being on stage, singing and dancing together. (Smiled.)  
**J:**
I like the process of training off stage, and performing on stage to see fans supporting us.
I'm very happy at that moment.  
**R:**
I like attending activities all over.
Because we can walk around and have snacks in leisure time.
I'm a "chi huo"(吃货, one who loves eating, somewhat similar to "foodie").

**Q:**
Don't you need to keep on a diet?
Why did you eat so many Spicy McWings?  
**R:**
It should be in a little control. (Smiled.)
We can't have something oily, like hot pot.  
**K:**
Indeed. Acne is a problem in adolescence.

**Q:**
What do your best friends act like after you become popular?  
**K:**
Just be normal, sometimes they praise or encourage me.  
**J:**
They ask for signatures to give their friends, and are proud.  
**R:**
There's no change.
They still pick me up for barbecues, are normal as usual.  
**K:**
Don't have too many barbecues, it's not good to throat.  
**R:**
That's right! That's right! (Clapped hands.)

**Q:**
Does the activities influence your school study?  
**R:**
Not much. I can't leave school for too long, just about one or two days a week, one time per month.
This month is a exception, it's busier at the end of a year. My teachers take extra lessons for me.  
**K:**
I suspended my performances last year for the entrance examination.
Now in Grade One of senior middle school, some courses, like maths, are difficult to catch up with.
I would ask my teachers and classmates, or take lessons from a tutor.

**Q:**
Jackson's always a "xue ba"(学霸, one who's score ranks top in class or school).  
**J:**
That's a long time ago.
The rank is not that good now, as there are many activities.
But after a period of time, I will focus on my study like Karry in the last year, to prepare for the entrance examination.

**Q:**
Are your parents worried when you are out of home?  
**K:**
I don't have much time to see them.
Because my school is far from home, about one and a half hours away.
I get up at six, and go back home at nine forty-five P.M. and sleep.
There's not much time to talk to them.
But they enjoin me in health and study.  
**R:**
It's okay when I'm in school.
They worry about the diet when I'm away, and make me eat too much when I'm back.
I used to weight 5 kilograms up in one month.
I'm eating quite well in fact, but they don't know, so they would make feasts of bone soup and such.

**Q:**
There are so many "mum fans", are your mum envious?  
**K:**
Maybe she don't know this. (Smiled.)

**Q:**
YANG Mi told you to "be in love a bit later", what do you think?
Are you afraid that be in love will break the fans' heart?  
**K:**
But it's impossible not to be in love. (Smiled.)
But we're not mature at present, it won't be early to be (in love).  
**J:**
That may hurt their hearts, may you don't lose control of yourself. (Smiled.)  
**R:**
I think this is what we are certain to do.
Yes, that's it.
