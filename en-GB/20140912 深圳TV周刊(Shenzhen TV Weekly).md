# TFBOYS:
# CUTE HEALING BOYS CAME, MUM FANS ATTRACTED

A Weibo post on exam has been reposted 600,000 times, the fans' comments can be rated as "the bank of knowledge".  
An MV has been played over 40 million times, broke the record kept by the mostly well-known dance music "Zui Xuan Minzu Feng"(最炫民族风, literally: "The Most Dazzling Folk Style").  
A sculpted ticket of the "Generation Show" episode they attended cost 10,000 yuan at most, while over 30 fans were swindled.  
Wherever they go, "mum fans" would welcome them at the airport, even before dawn. Professional photographic equipment and supporting materials are their standard configuration.  
...

It's not a Korean pop group coming, all these sensational effects that can make other top stars jealousy were caused by TFBOYS, a group of three cute Chinese boys aged under fourteen -- WANG Jun-kai, WANG Yuan, and YI Yang-qian-xi.
On 28th Aug., at the shooting site of "Generation Show", we saw their overwhelming popularity out of photos and videos, and felt the same with Ling-hua(玲花) of "Phoenix Legend"(凤凰传奇),
"The world is yours, as well as ours, but in the last analysis, it is yours!"

## Cute, Animated, Positive
**Gained Popularity in the "bit world"**

"Qian-xi, keep smiling on the stage, don't keep your lips closed."
"WANG Yuan, don't open your legs when standing."
In the waiting room of "Generation Show", the manager Ms. REN was urging the members in tender solemnness.
The waiting rooms of "Generation Show" are divided into two parts, two half-open rooms are for emcees and common guests, and the VIP room is only for very important guests
-- it served Wallace Chung(钟汉良) and William Chan(陈伟霆) recently, and now for TFBOYS.
The three burly guards at the door were also declaring their popularity.

To explore their path of being popular, let's date back to Aug. 2013.
This group named TFBOYS, which means "The Fighting Boys", came. Three healing and pure boys, WANG Jun-kai, WANG Yuan, and YI Yang-qian-xi, debuted with a short film called "Ten Years".
In less than a year, the fans called "Clovers" brought them higher and higher popularity on the web, crowded welcome queues at the airports, and jams on their shows.

However, the concern from media only started this March, when it released the MV of "Magic Castle", and broke the long lasting record with a number of over 40 million times of play.
The boys already gained huge popularity from the "bit world" before mainstream media's concern.
Just as Ms. REN mentioned, TFBOYS does not soar to popularity in a sudden.
As early as four years ago did Beijing Time Fengjun start the plan of trainees, and prepare for a long time.
"We found the lack of such a market in China, the trainee mode here is immature.
Johnny & Associates of Japan and SM Entertainment of Korea do quite well, we wish to build up a complete chain by ourselves."

Doing well in school study is another aspect TFBOYS differs from Japanese and Korean teen groups.
Their cute, animated, and positive image is an important part of the attraction.
Professional manager JI Xiang(纪翔) agrees with it,
"the popularity of TFBOYS is not an accident, but a result of solid market basis.
It can be seen as the reincarnation of the fashion trend of 'Xiao Hu Dui'(小虎队, Little Tigers)."
"Well-behaved tiger" Alec Su(苏有朋) was once an example in the heart of parents for his image as a good boy.
Now, when other children are travelling and sleeping, the three boys of TFBOYS have to take their homework to backstage, enrich their summer vacation with many activities.

## "With Ten-Year's Companion, For the Glory of Coronation"
**To Some Sense, Fans Are Like "Mums"**

The "trainee mode" TFBOYS adopted, is to select trainees from 8- to 14-year-old boys, perform training, and debut.
Except the images, the fully disclosed training process is more important.
The initiative of fans made TFBOYS a group entirely designed and forged with fans.
It accords with the interest of fans from the beginning, with no need of drawing over concern with special works.
On the other hand, the participation in the cultivation and promotion evokes the responsibility and the sense of achievement of fans, which enhances the adherence and loyalty.

According to the agency, a trainee's debut is determined by strict selection in the beginning, as well as the fans' interest later on.
Ms. MA, a head of the agency, said, the standing out of WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan is chose by fans.
"From 2009, we published videos of the trainees on the web, to test the response of the fans.
Our taste won't work if the fans aren't interested.
The popularity is out of our control."
Although the agency had stated on TV that TFBOYS ["the trainees", in fact] won't debut before being grown-ups, the strong reaction of the cover of "Dang Ai Yi Cheng Wangshi"(当爱已成往事, literally: "When Love Becomes the Past") and "Yangcong"(洋葱, Onion) prompted the agency to adjust its strategy, push out the group earlier.

The fans of TFBOYS were often called "mum fans".
To some sense, they are really like TFBOYS's mothers.
Therefore, their slogan is set to "With Ten-year's Companion, For the Glory of Coronation".
This is a promise of the fans -- witness the bright future of their idols with ten-year's support and companion.

**Q&A**
## Nominated in Ice Bucket Challenge by ZHANG Zi-yi
**"Unexpected", and "Funny"**

*[ZHANG Zi-yi(章子怡)]*

*[Q - the magazine, K - WANG Jun-kai(Karry), R - WANG Yuan(Roy), J - YI Yang-qian-xi(Jackson)]*

**Q:**
I've seen your tight schedule, are you travelling around China in the whole summer vacation?  
**K:**
Mostly attending activities everywhere.
It's tired, but happy that so many people supports us.
And we are always training hard, studying more.

**Q:**
What did you do to be a "xue ba" during busy work?  
**K:**
Be concentrated on studies and training, they won't influence each other.  
**J:**
I put myself into study on weekdays, and work on weekends.  
**R:**
I'm not quite adapted when entering junior middle school, but I'm progressing a lot.
Anyhow, school study should not be dropped.

**Q:**
Many fans likes you because you are "meng"(萌, means cute or adorable, derived from Japanese word "moe"), will you keep being cute?  
**R:**
We are getting older, we can't be cute as before.
We are always training hard to improve our strength, only in this way can we remain popular.
I choose to be vital and warm, I'll be transforming!
(The serious expression is so cute!)

**Q:**
Actually, the changing voice may be a bigger trouble.
How do you deal with it?  
**K:**
Drink more water, not to eat spicy food, not to speak loudly, sing less, in order to protect the throat.  
**J:**
Just sing, be accommodated to the voice.  
**R:**
Let it be.

**Q:**
Seen from the shoot, you are quite adapted to cameras and stage.
Do you act the same in private?
Who differs the most?  
**K&R:**
Jackson.
(**Q:** Why?)  
**J:**
Why?  
**K:**
Jackson is very reserved and calm on stage, like a boss.
But he's very playful like us.

**Q:**
As "Qian Zong"(Boss Qian, a nickname of Jackson called by fans) is "gao leng"[高冷, a buzzword in China, originally means "act as an elite and be indifferent to others". But usually simply means "calm and cool".] and Karry is shy, then the talkative one is...  
**K&J:**
Roy!  
**R:**
Eh... I'm like a "spokesman", and good at emceeing except singing, I think.
I host all the activities in school, and I want to be an excellent emcee like HE Jiong(何炅).
JJ Lin(林俊杰) and G.E.M.(Gloria Tang Tsz-kei, 鄧紫棋) are also my goals.

**Q:**
You've been nominated in the Ice Bucket Challenge by ZHANG Zi-yi. How did you feel?
You seemed very calm when dumping.  
**K:**
We haven't seen her before, it's quite unexpected but we were very happy.
And the challenge was very funny.

**Q:**
It reflected your popularity.  
**R:**
We are not very popular now.
Popular means that wherever you go, people there know you and your works, like Jay Chou.
But we are only popular in some circles.
We should work hard for a long time.

**Q:**
The fans gave you much strength, but it's inevitable of facing negatives in show biz.
How do you think about them?  
**R:**
I'm unhappy at first, very sad.
I think they didn't notice our striving.
But later, I choose not to pay attention to them.  
**K:**
We will work harder to become better.

**Q:**
You met EXO in a mid-autumn gala, what's your feeling? Many netizens like to compare you two.  
**J:**
They are senior, it's hard to compare with them, and we don't want to be compared.
And I hope the fans don't, they are examples we can learn from.  
**K:**
They are very skilled in dancing, we should learn from them. We won't mind the popularity.

## Don't Know the New "Four Sects"?
**You Are Out**

Even if you know the new "King of Four", the new "Four Hua Dan"[花旦, lively, vivacious young female characters in Chinese Opera], the new "Four Beauties of the Capital", the new "Four Prince of the Capital", ...
But the ignorant of the "Four Sects" on Weibo -- WANG Si-cong(王思聪)'s wives, HAN Han(韩寒)'s sons-in-law, LI Yi-feng(李易峰)'s girlfriends, and TFBOYS's mums -- you are totally out.

Among them, TFBOYS's mums are a group of most worried mothers in the world.
Besides interactions on the web, some fans would try everything to make close contact with idols

eating noodles at a shop opposite to WANG Jun-kai's school,
even a back photo of WANG Jun-kai taken by the shop owner can be reposted over 3,000 times in one day.

Thus, no need to exclaim at the rapid replacement of Lee Minho(이민호, 李敏鎬) by Kim Soohyun(김수현, 金秀賢), because there's already another replacement.
