### A Cultivation Game of TFBOYS

In this real star cultivation game where money and influence determine the result, three boys under fifteen are the actors.
They are gaining concern by paddling their real life, while fighting and strengthening to become new stars.
Behind the scene, there lies the eternal strong demand of human beings -- youths need entertainers to fill up their inner world.

> Written by LUO Ting(罗婷)

Around 2000, a star cultivation game in Taiwan called "Mingxing Zhiyuan"(明星志愿, literally: "Star Wish") was hot in China.
In its settings, the player cultivates a star on his will.
In the game, the player should guarantee the quality and quantity of the works of the star he/she cultivates, while the star may encounter accidents, learn to face media, have love affair.
The game will then grade the star according to his/her fame, talents, and performance. The player should pour in a large amount of time, affection, and money to cultivate his/her "virtual idol".

Over ten years later, the star cultivation mode in the game become true.
Beijing Time Fengjun rented offices in a building in Chongqing, started choosing boys aged 8 to 14, determined to make them super stars in the real world.

In the beginning, it is like a gambling.
This agency had no staff ever involved in show biz, most of the selected boys exited due to the loneliness and baldness of the training.

At last, 14-year-old WANG Yuan, 15-year-old WANG Jun-kai, and 14-year-old YI Yang-qian-xi got the entrance ticket after five years' training and assessment.
They formed TFBOYS, roared to fame in one year with the assistant of fans, which created a miracle
-- attracting over five million fans, winning awards, endorsing ads with promotion fee of 200 million yuan[not endorsement fee], performing at mid-autumn festival gala of CCTV.

Many adults are confused at their fame.
LU Jian(鲁健), an emcee of 2014 CCTV Mid-Autumn Festival Gala, was astonished by TFBOYS's fans on his road to the hotel,
"on the road, and outside the hotel, I saw many children, mostly junior middle school students, were shouting.
I doubted whose fans are they.
After that time did I know how popular TFBOYS is."

In fact, though young in age, plain in singing skill, neighbour-like in looks, the boys have already shaken adult idols in show biz.
YANG Mi(杨冪) calls WANG Jun-kai "Dage"(大哥, literally: "big brother"), ZHANG Jie(张杰) showed his praise in public, ZHANG Zi-yi(章子怡) nominated them in the Ice Bucket Challenge.
WANG Jun-kai's weibo on exam preparation was forwarded 600,000 times, which exceeds the forwards of most of Faye Wong(王菲)'s weibo.
A sculpted ticket of the show they attended priced at 6,000 yuan, which was equivalent to Lee Minho(李敏镐, 이민호) or Kim Soohyun(金秀贤, 김수현).
They were awarded the most popular group in mainland China in a competition with Phoenix Legend(凤凰传奇)[False.] and SJ-M of Korea.
Their new song "Magic Castle"(魔法城堡) broke the hit record kept for several years by "Zui Xuan Minzu Feng"(最炫民族风, literally: "The Most Dazzling Folk Style") of Phoenix Legend,
and Ling-hua(玲花), the singer of the song, said, "The world is yours, as well as ours, but in the last analysis, it is yours!"

WANG Chang-tian(王长田), the CEO of Enlight Media(光线传媒), had once sighed at the speed of these teens' popularity,
"the popularity pace of entertainers now is different.
Jay Chou(周杰伦) went to fame quite fast, but he spent several years.
But a group called TFBOYS became widely known in only one year."

### Real Role Playing Game

Three years ago, the three boys were like other common boys.
WANG Jun-kai was in Grade One of Chongqing No.8 Secondary School.
Like his peers, he would play basketball first at the lunch break.
At that time, he would have lunch at the café opposite to his school, no need to worry about the crowd.
His scores ranked the average in class, his teacher had said,
"It's unsuitable for him to be admitted to Tsinghua University, he should develop according to his personal characteristics."

In a new building in the suburb of Jiulongpo District of Chongqing, WANG Yu-lan(王玉兰), a neighbour of WANG Jun-kai told us, she had a good impression to this boy nicknamed "Song-song"(嵩嵩).
She said, his family is not rich, they moved from their old house only years ago due to land demolition.
His father is a taxi driver, his mother used to work in a barber shop, while his grandfather was bedridden for years.
This boy would cook dinner and send warm messages to his mother in Mother's Day, and he did well in school study.

Another member WANG Yuan was born in Dadukou District of Chongqing.
It's easy to notice the cracks in the wall of his home in an early TV interview, a piano is of the most precious.
His mother said he's not "materialised", had only an inexpensive feature phone.

YI Yang-qian-xi lives in Beijing, his family has the best condition among the three.
He started his "star dream" at seven, attended many shows and contests, but remained tepid.
In 2009, he joined a group called "Feixuan Shaonian"(飞炫少年), which didn't become popular. In the long time trials, he hadn't found a direction.

Like other teenagers, this three boys are not outstanding in looks, talents, and family conditions, as well as in performances.

It's an absolutely coincidence for WANG Jun-kai to take this road.
In 2010, when he's in Grade Five of Panlong Primary School, he was found by a scout on his way to the wash room.
"Raise your head. Smile." The scout said.
WANG Jun-kai, who was later admitted to Chongqing No.8 Secondary School with an excellent score, never thought about such a possibility before.
He even left a wrong phone number to the scout unconsciously.
The agency didn't give up, and made contact with his parents later.
His mother GONG Sheng-hui(龚声会) visited the agency, "thought it wasn't a fraud," and consented to the training.

Similar to WANG Jun-kai, WANG Yuan was in Dajiang Primary School when his mother ZHOU Ting-fen(周廷芬) surprisingly received a phone call from the agency.
The agency was full of sincerity, its staff came to WANG Yuan's home to communicate with them.
The doubting mother visited the agency, and agreed to WANG Yuan's joining.

OU-YANG Tian-ge(欧阳田戈), one of the first trainees of Time Fengjun who joined at the same year with WANG Jun-kai, recalled that he met scouts of the agency when he's attending an exam of an art school after he graduated from primary school at eleven.
They gave out leaflets of "A Trainee Project About to Start" to boys looking forward to be stars.

Chongqing is teem with audition stars.
In 2005, when "Super Boy" and "Super Girl" of Hunan TV were the top show, the most active area were Chongqing and Sichuan.
All kinds of scouts, true or fake, are always active in the school-gathering Shapingba(沙坪坝) District and Jiefangbei CBD.

The bungling leaflet was doubtful, many parents thought it was a fraud.
But the agency didn't conceal its ambition.
It told the parents that it was to simulate Johnny & Associates of Japan.
Johnny & Associates was found in 1975, it recruits boys aged 10 to 14, trains them in leisure time, which includes vocal music, instruments, dance, showmanship, performance, etc.
Talented ones will be formed in a group and debut after several years.
Many national groups were created by Johnny & Associates, including Kimura Takuya(木村拓哉) of SMAP and Arashi.

HUANG Tun(黄暾), the director of five MVs of TFBOYS, remembered that LI Fei(李飞), the boss of Time Fengjun, had mentioned AKB48 of Japan several times with him, and said "AKB48 are idols you can meet face-to-face".
LI thought, though the mode of AKB48 is not replicable, the feeling can be simulated.
Actually, SNH48, a sister group of AKB48, was under preparation in Shanghai.
Its members are elder girls, aimed at audiences of otaku.

In Chongqing, WANG Jun-kai was studying in classroom.

"8 to 12 years old, positive appearance, well-developed figure, coordinate body;
interested in vocal music, street dance, etc.;
have ambition of developing in arts or entertainment."
These were the recruiting requirements the agency posted on websites.
Mary, a staff of the agency, had said in an interview that well-featured look is mandatory, they should be handsome, and cute.

At that time, the agency wasn't cautious and meticulous as now.
Mary had said, "Our boss is a Beijinger doing business on real estate in Chongqing.
He is an entertainer himself, and found the promising prospect of the art training market in Chongqing.
So he introduced the training mode in."

Insiders told us, this merchant called LI Fei is a respected person in Beijing real estate circle, but hadn't set feet to show biz.
Backed by plenty capital, the agency is prepared to long term investment.
Mary was very confident in an interview.
"Training agencies lacking economic strengths are usually dragged down.
This is an opportunity for us on the contrary."

The money and the trainees are on their marks, the cultivation game started off.
Just like the game "Mingxing Zhiyuan", these reserve stars should experience the checkpoints of fame, works, and performances.

Time Fengjun knows "popularity is everything", it admitted that "although the number of fans doesn't make the decision, but fans usually determine a star's popularity."
Before formally joining the agency, a boy should take a three-month probation.
How many fans they have, and how popular are they among netizens, is an important index.
During the probation, the agency releases their training videos, art photos, and make-up photos on several websites and Baidu Tieba.
A staff will collect the comments and opinions, as well as the number of fans.

OU-YANG Tian-ge told us, from the very first day he entered the agency, there's a staff shooting them with a camera, in classes, training, rehearsals, and breaks.
Even dinner parties of the agency were recorded.
This was the first time he had a sense that "this is the cultivation, these would be the videos others watch on the Web."
Besides, the agency registered Weibo accounts and Baidu Tieba accounts for the trainees, let them share their lives with netizens.
This is a method highly suitable in the new media age -- record every aspect of the boys' lives and push them to audiences.
This is "The Truman Show".

After the selection in popularity, "cute and handsome" boy WANG Jun-kai was among the few lucky ones, and joined Time Fengjun.
The agency, the parents, and the boys signed their names on the contracts, bundled their fates together therefrom.
While over twenty trainees eliminated due to the look or the lack of attracting fans.

In this game, the biggest test is the endurance.
WANG Jun-kai, the leader of TFBOYS, is the "senior" trainee of Time Fengjun.
He experienced nearly four years' trainee life.
Every day in weekends and holidays, this boy should have his training 9-to-5.
He had to wake up at 6, take a bus for nearly two hours from his home in Jiulongpo District to the agency.
The training provided includes vocal music, dance, instruments, performance, magic show, showmanship, creation skills.
What WANG Jun-kai learns are mainly vocal music, dance, and guitar.

The office of Time Fengjun sits on the 18th floor of a building on Yangtze River, where all trainees receive such training at the same time.
OU-YANG said, the agency changed at least six teachers on street dance in three years.
These teachers didn't teach basic skills much, but complete dances which can be shown directly.
But the turnover is too frequent, a teacher left before we are familiar with a dance, another came and taught us a completely different one.
"I had little sense of the identity as a trainee, nor the cruel competition others mentioned.
I came here for fun, to make friends." OU-YANG said.

Differs from OU-YANG, WANG Jun-kai had said that he will do his best to "become popular".
So does WANG Yuan, who had said, "I'm a fan of Jay Chou, he's very famous, and I want to be like him."

Not everyone can endure the long-time waiting in the game.
Although the training's free, a trainee gets 500 yuan allowance each month, rooms and boards are provided in holidays for those lived in suburb, many quitted due to the vague future.
After the expiration of contracts in the summer of 2013, the first nine trainees except WANG Jun-kai left due to the bleak prospect or school study, OU-YANG was among them.
He told us that he didn't learn anything there.

HUANG Tun thought that the success of TFBOYS is based on the huge amount of trainees recruited.
Once who becomes more handsome, the agency starts to promote him.
When HUANG first saw WANG Yuan in 2012, he's a chubby little boy.
In one year, he became a delicate-profiled pretty boy.

Former trainee ZHANG Xiao(张啸) recalled that the agency promised that after a not-long training time, they will debut, take ads, attend contests, perform in TV shows, and even go abroad.
Mary had introduced that after the appraisal by their professional evaluation team, outstanding trainees can debut from well-known entertainment agencies, and others can get professional development in arts.
The future is bright, the road is expectable.
But in three years, except a contest without getting a place, and being a backup dancer for WANG Jun-kai in the MV of "Wo Bu Yao Gaibian"(我不要改变, literally: "I Don't Want to Change"), he had no other chance to show.
ZHANG though the three years was not successful for him,
"there's no debut, no MV, no ad, and no TV show.
I won't be popular if I stay here."

Later, ZHANG Xiao left and entered Chongqing Professional Art School, to receive professional folk dance training.
Now, 16-year-old ZHANG is experiencing another uncertain life
-- he had to pass the arts exam of which the acceptance rate is 1/200, and pass the college entrance exam, before been admitted to STA(上海戏剧学院, Shanghai Theatre Academy).

After TFBOYS became popular, their early training videos with other trainees were found out, ZHANG Xiao was somewhat concerned.
When being a trainee, he's the best friend of WANG Jun-kai.
Regarding the friend's fame, his expression turned complicated.
He denied being regretful with four "not" -- "I do not feel sad, is not grieved, do not feel pity, will not regret."

Nowadays, one can usually see fans calling him to come back on his Weibo account.
Many times in night, this boy tried to edit the diction, to tell them "I am still fighting, wish you still remember me when I'm in college."
But gave up before sending it out.
"Forget it, don't post it."
He threw away the phone, immerse himself into the shabby dance room until totally exhausted, day after day.
He told us, he's just waiting longer.
After entering a college, "being success is still possible."

Success means hardship, diet control is only a simple one among them.
HUANG Tun had seen the driver of the agency buying many McDonald's hamburgers just for the attached toys.
WANG Jun-kai likes McDonald and coke, likes McDonald's toys, but can't eat the junk food, he can only satisfy his appetite with those toys.

GONG Sheng-hui, WANG Jun-kai's mother, said, "Behind the fame, it's very hard."
WANG Jun-kai had once told her, "mum, I'm so tired, it's aching and sore all over."
In an early video, there's a scene showing his tears when pressing legs.
When a staff asked him in concern, he shook his head and said it's nothing.

For not being eliminated in this cruel system, WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan as trainees, started training themselves consciously.
WANG Yuan once thought that he needed only singing skills as he had accepted professional vocal training.
Only after being a trainee of a reserve star did he know that dance and showmanship are also important.
Due to lack of basic skills in dance, he had to start from scratch, endured much pain in the training.

The two boys under 15 set off on a long journey with training, covering songs, and attending competitions.
WANG Yuan, his mother said, was shy in primary school, would blush when making a statement in class, and cry if didn't perform well in a recitation contest.
This little boy would have supplementary training by himself after leaving the agency.
On 8th Dec., 2012, on their way home, WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan sang "Renzhi"(人质, literally: "Hostage") at a simple open karaoke booth at Wanda Plaza in Chongqing CBD.
Facing the surrounding people, the two boys finished the song fluently, were not frightened at all.
There's even someone giving them money.
Besides this singing, WANG Yuan had sung in underground passages among many people several times.

In games aiming at upgrading, the role initially have the simplest equipment, is easy to fail.
These rookies were also always facing the danger of "dying young".

At first, the agency had no professional voice recording equipment, simple microphone and KTV-like decoration were what fans scoff at.
The costumes prepared for the boys had been found out that those were common clothes at low prices.
HUANG Tun told us, the budget of an MV was sometimes too low that he had to subsidize.

In June, 2013, the agency made a cover of "Yangcong"(洋葱, Onion) with the theme of "Finding Mother" according to a trainee, WANG Yi-feng(王译锋), who seldom sees his mother.
When making the MV, the boss LI Fei stayed at the shooting site, was much worried about whether it will be hot or not.
He asked the director, "How do you feel about it?"
HUANG said, "It's fantastic, I've never made such a work before. This may be the best."
Finally, this covering video was forwarded by Ashine(阿信) of MayDay(五月天), got over 30 million hits.
This jittery and gingerly small agency tasted the sweet from the Web for the first time.

In the cultivation game, this is the first success for trainees WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan.
Though promised not to debut before being grown-ups, the agency realised that this may be a chance.
LI Fei decided to add a new member. He turned to the 12-year-old boy YI Yang-qian-xi, who's in Grade One of Affiliated Senior Middle School of BUCT(北京化工大学, Beijing University of Chemical Technology).

LI had wrote the story of inviting YI Yang-qian-xi.
LI met him in 2012 on a teen's audition program "Up! Juniors"(向上吧！少年), his excellent dance may well recover the weakness of WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan, and his reserved and endurable character is a plus.
LI wanted to make a sign and had a phone number exchange with his mother, but he's already in an agency at the time, which foiled the effort.
Now in the creation of TFBOYS, he was called to LI's mind.

After the invitation, TFBOYS had its shape.
Good-looking and singing-skilled leader WANG Jun-kai is the charmer and vocalist, active and adorable WANG Yuan is the emcee and vocalist, while dancing-skilled YI Yang-qian-xi is of course the dancer.
His experience of being ranked the top in school brought them an image of "good students" in Chinese traditional values.

In Oct., 2013, TFBOYS was preparing the first work -- the EP "Heart Meng·Chufa"(Heart梦·出发, literally: "Heart, Dream Starts Off").
The creation is quite a headache for HUANG Tun, he found his controlling and freedom of the MV was much weakened.
Differed from those before their debut which had no scripts and advanced preparation, the boss asked him to shoot exactly via the story board.

In the first try, HUANG let the boys dance at twice the speed and shoot in half the speed, and spray water in the air to build an illusionary atmosphere in low speed.
Such ideas were refused as "having risk" and "uncontrollable", with some clips removed in the post-editing.
At the time, LI Fei deemed that "the debut should be regular and accustomed, the practised paths are the best."
Later in the shoot, both LI Fei and HUANG Tun were very "anxious" and "impatient", and finally parted.
At last, the editing was handed over to a company with experiences of stars' MVs.

In this game, the roles should have skills of facing media.
The three boys have to learn the rules of answering journalists.
In the evening of 17th Oct., nearly four months after the invitation, our journalist met TFBOYS at the backstage of CCTV.
After finishing the recording and photographing with staffs in the crowd dressing room, hadn't cleaned the make-up, the three tired boys still showed sweet smile to our journalist and said hello.
An assistant handed over the outline of the interview, in which the questions like "how do you take your idol identity", "are you embarrassed at the closely following fans", and "how do you think of the birthday celebration at the fans' expense" were removed due to "sensitive".
TFBOYS refused the advice of sitting down, finished the interview on their feet all over, while the answers were riskless "thankful to fans" and "we'll strive on".

Although conserved and scrupulous, this young teenage group faces accidents.
Sometimes, it came from another unfamiliar region for them -- politics.

On 20th Oct., 2014, a Weibo account on show biz posted "it is said that TFBOYS are banned due to its harmful example."
It said that due to the inconformity of the determination of "literature and art should not be the slave of the market" at the literature and art work conference recently, the related department saw TFBOYS as a harmful example and deprecated the promotion on TV, and some already cancelled the cooperation.
Some fans found that iQiyi(爱奇艺), which often shows TFBOYS on the main page, hided everything about them.
Several days later, although Time Fengjun declared that "the rumour is totally a fraud", the team told media not to report them at the time.

In Sept., 2014, fans from all over China gathered in Chongqing to celebrate WANG Jun-kai's fifteenth birthday.

### "With My Dim Light, Guard Your Boundless Glory"

On 15th Apr., 2014, TFBOYS came to an important battle in the cultivation game.
As "Magic Castle" ranked in the front of the Yinyuetai's chart for a long time, the organiser decided to invite them to attend the award ceremony, but to win the award, they had to be "The Most Popular Singer in Mainland China".

To win the award, they had to defeat ZHOU Bi-chang(周笔畅), the runner-up of 2005 "Super Girl", and SJ-M, a popular Korean idol group.

The fan LIN Yu-mei said, it was the first battle she participated in for her idol, it was the time she will never forget.
The battle was meaningful for the young idols and their fans.
"There's no other way! We must take them to the stage."
A fan said in a chart promotion QQ group "Toffee Promotion Group"(太妃站打榜群).

In that promotion group, nearly a hundred fans kept refreshing the video page of "Magic Castle" day and night, marking favourite, commenting, and downloading, to promote the score of the MV on the chart.
According to the website's settings, there's a counting limit for each account and IP address, and 200 accounts are recorded at most in one IP address.
But this was not a problem, the promotion group reserved thousands of new accounts and prepared IP address converter.

LIN Yu-mei is in Grade One of a senior middle school in Quanzhou, Fujian.
She described her day of chart promotion to us:
except having classes in the day, she did the promotion with a PC at home at lunch break and after school.
She got nearly 800 accounts from an administer, to login, exit, login another account continuously, to transfer between the PC and the mobile phone.
In ten days, the girl replayed the song over 1,000 times.
Someone's even more exaggerated -- a fan and her two friends used 23 phones, 41 PCs, over 3,000 accounts for the chart promotion.

Finally, TFBOYS won the award and stood on stage.
When got the message, LIN on his way home cannot help crying.

But this game has no end.
When TFBOYS were to stand on the stage, the organiser said there is a "Popular Singer in Yin Yue Live".
Unlike "The Most Popular Singer Award" depending on the playing of MV, this award needed money
-- one RMB equivalents a virtual trophy, the star who receive the most trophies won.

Everyone knew it's thoroughly a game about money, but the fans agreed that "to take them on the stage again, money's nothing."
The organiser set a limit of twenty trophies per account, but a fan at the stadium used over 60 accounts to give over 1,200 trophies.
In three hours, the fans poured 200,000 yuan to help the boys won again.

Outside WANG Yuan's school, every stationary shop has pirate commodities about him.(Photographed by LIU Song(刘嵩))

Paved by countless fans' time and money, 14-year-old WANG Jun-kai, 13-year-old WANG Yuan, and 13-year-old YI Yang-qian-xi won the awards of "The Most Popular Singer in Mainland China" and "The Popular Singer in Yin Yue Live" at the ceremony.

This was the first time they walk on a red carpet, the first time they receive awards, the first time they were surrounded by flowers, and the first time they sang on a big stage with lime light and cameras all round.
The two trophies were the first praise on their way of being stars.

TFBOYS's fans took the experience more meaningful.
They treat it as the substitution in show biz, the farewell to the era of singing contests, the combat of domestic trainees with Japanese and Korean groups.
On the stage, the three boys fight and upgrade, show their prepared performances.
Off the stage, the fans fight and pour in time and money.

Time Fengjun wish to build up a group one can "meet face-to-face", "accompany the growth".
The manager REN Jiao-jiao had said, "our member don't have plenty of time for training, we have to act and train at the same time. We emphasize the direct companion and growth with fans."
For that companion, the agency made video clips on the web, hype through hot issues, release self-made dramas and shows every week, to maintain the fans concern.

In such a system, the group members peddle their real life process, while the players pay the bill for the companionship.
This companion mode means that the players pay not only time and affection, this is a pyramid system that the rich win.

LIN Yu-mei was at the bottom of the pyramid, she called herself a "transparent".
She told us, such fans were beyond count. The bottom of the pyramid lies the "transparent" who have no money to give presents and take their flights, but do the chart promotion and the web purification.

LIN never interrupted the chart promotion.
TFBOYS's new song "Lucky Symbol"(幸运符号), which release in Aug. 2014, ranked the top on Yinyue V-Chart for nine weeks till the end of Nov.
Then songs of HUA Chen-yu(华晨宇), Kris Wu(吴亦凡), and other singers came, the rank of "Lucky Symbol" started floating frequently.
However, the chart at the end of year was much related to all kinds of awards.
In dozens of chart promotion QQ groups for TFBOYS, a new battle was on.
In a QQ group called "Yinyue V-Chart scattered promotion group", our journalist found the fans sent about 10,000 messages on average per day.
They were shouting "fighting", "the army's coming", "fight for TFBOYS".

A Grade Three senior middle school student did the promotion all along the three-hour self-study every day, a Grade Two junior school student did the promotion in cyber café after school.
They kept refreshing, replaying, marking favourite, commenting, and downloading, some even didn't sleep.
In other words, that TFBOYS's MV of "The Youth Manual"(青春修炼手册) get 50 million hits doesn't mean that 50 million people played it.

Besides, LIN and his friends learned the method of promoting TFBOYS's news to the top of websites.
Take Sina Weibo as an example, it is said that topics related to TFBOYS were limited on Hot Weibo Chart due to the excessive frequency. [Unconfirmed.]
Later, fans found that if the forwards, comments, and likes of a weibo reaches a certain amount in a certain period of time, it can still be pushed to the Chart.
And "if we want to push a weibo to the Chart, we don't use topics when forwarding."

LIN does so-called "purification"(means to eliminate negative information about TFBOYS) on Baidu every day.
When typing "WANG Jun-kai" in the search box, there appears a menu showing entries about WANG Jun-kai, like "WANG Jun-kai's girlfriend" and "WANG Jun-kai scores high".
What LIN does is to click the positive entries on and on, make its index higher, which in turn reduces the rank of negative ones, and finally disappear.

In this circle with precise division of labour, most fans have only time to pay out, maintain the affection with idols by the chart promotion.
But some enjoy the idols' appreciation directly using money.

On 28th Nov., 2014, if you were in the fourth ring of Beijing, you would find the photo of a boy with neat bangs and dimples everywhere, with words saying "YI Yang-qian-xi, Happy Birthday".

For the birthday, the fans spent hundreds of thousands of RMB to rent the billboards in subway between Yong'anli(永安里) Station and Guomao(国贸) Station, the body of Bus 101 which stops at the Forbidden City, the bus stop boards at Huixindongqiao(惠新东桥).
His video was played on the largest LED screen in Chang'an Avenue which nears Tian'anmen all day long.

This is not unique.
This August, at WANG Jun-kai's 15th birthday, the fans rented the largest LED screen in his home town Chongqing, mountainous gifts were delivered by truck.
This November, at WANG Yuan's 14th birthday, the celebrating ads spread over buses, metro stations, and a sky wheel of Chongqing.

A well-off fan Jenny became a fan after watching WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan's covering video in May, 2014, when she was studying in the UK.
As a new fan, the past videos the agency released over the years took effect -- she spent only several days to know the five years hardship and striving of WANG Jun-kai through and through.
She was moved by this persistent boy, and thought he has advantages what her well-off peers don't.
In the next half year, Jenny was entrapped deeper and deeper, spent over 200,000 yuan in the fending for WANG Jun-kai.

Jenny saw WANG Jun-kai at Chongqing Jiangbei Airport for the first time, as a girl who had seen many stars and gone to Korea for idols' concert, she found him so different.
In her eyes, WANG Jun-kai is a thin and lovely boy, who's nervous at the surrounding fans, not as calm as adult stars.
"But they had to listen to the manager, they stopped when the manager told them to, they turned their back to the wall when the manager told them to. It's pitiful."

She stated her pitiful feeling as a mother's mind, the fans with such mind are called "mum fans".

To Jenny's surprise, the new style clothes and shoes of KENZO's she sent to WANG Jun-kai were put on in public soon after their recording of "Happy Camp"(快乐大本营).
Such response made Jenny excited, which she never had from her former idol group EXO of Korea.

After that, she called up over a dozen of fans, found a fan site called "Glory"(荣光), with the slogan "With My Dim Light, Guard Your Boundless Glory".
Most fans in the site had their work, some immigrated to the US or Spain.

Being motivated by that response, Jenny sent more gifts when WANG Jun-kai finished the exam in June, in TFBOYS's debut anniversary, on his birthday in September.

In the gift list she showed us, many kinds of goods can be seen:
a guitar costs about 20,000 yuan, iPad, camera, dozens of famous brand clothes, even a bracelet consecrated by an eminent monk.
There were also perfume and scarf for his mother.
Most of the gifts had been taken to his home and used in daily life.
Soon, she got WANG Jun-kai's signature for "Glory": "Sisters of Glory, thank you for your support."
"He wrote slowly and carefully." Jenny told us.

Staffs of Time Fengjun may also receive sounders, microphones, and food like mitten crabs, wines, and cakes.
At WANG Jun-kai's birthday, over thirty blue gift boxes with white bow-knots were delivered to the agency by truck, several staffs carried all gifts upstairs in twice.

In games, players with no money improve the role's H.P. through the time spent, while players with money can directly buy equipment to arm the role, to upgrade easily.
In this game, Jenny is the later, she continuously buy nice costumes to her beloved idol, and the idol doesn't refuse the crowning from these fans.

"If the agency were not so unprofessional, the fans won't be so powerful, the potency won't be so strong." Jenny told us.
This August, after Jenny's gifts for the anniversary were delivered, LI Fei expressed appreciation in private:
"Thank you for your kindness, Karry[WANG Jun-kai] likes them."
Jenny knows WANG Jun-kai's friends and those who have contact with WANG Jun-kai in private.
Differs from the "transparent" like LIN Yu-mei, it's not difficult for her to get in touch with WANG Jun-kai or the boss of Time Fengjun.

"She and her 'Glory', sits at the top of the circle." LIN Zi stated.
Unlike Jenny, this girl just graduated, had no such amount of money.
But as a hard-core player in the cultivation game, she is much engaged in
-- she went to almost every activity TFBOYS attended, almost all commodities TFBOYS officially sold, sometimes took the same flight with TFBOYS when she had time.
In early November of 2014, YI Yang-qian-xi would fly to Chongqing for recording at Friday night and left to Beijing at Saturday night.
LIN Zi booked the same flights with him, only for being in the same space for four hours.

LIN Zi told us, "taking the same flight" is for "making familiar", is to make the boy remember her.
How to weigh the time and money poured in? Her standard is simple -- whether the idol knows her.
After some flights, she got YI Yang-qian-xi's signature twice, kept contact with his father via phone and WeChat.

On Weibo, LIN Zi is a "big shot" of the circle.
A "big shot" is a special fan who has a large number of followers and are well-informed about idol.
She had a particular Weibo account about TFBOYS, which has over 10,000 followers, is completely divided from her work.
This 22-year-old girl with nearly ten years' experience as a fan of Korean stars, is skilful in photograph and Photoshop, good photos can usually be forwarded over 10,000 times.
In sites which forbid camera, she even tried hiding the camera in her skirt.

Fans in LIN's friend circle are more or less the same: studying in college or just graduated, independent in economy, have plenty of time, have experience as fans.
These "big shots" cannot contact the head of Time Fengjun directly like Jenny, but have their own connections and relationship.
They know the flight number TFBOYS will take, unpublicized activities TFBOYS will attend, and hearsay unseen on Weibo.
Their survey and breaking ability are equal to journalists, they consider less when spending money.
LIN Zi had her own fan value:
"Are fans overdosed? No, our lives are normal.
Like men's favourite in football, which is just a personal hobby, we like this way of consumption."

ZHANG Liang(张亮), CIO of Innovation Works(创新工场) who had surveyed the operation of AKB48 of Japan, stated the factor behind those crazy action as such:
"Human beings are strange creatures, you may establish a very strong and firm affection with something instantly when you are young, and this irrational affection become a bright lamp lightening our solitary and boring youth.
Then, after you reach some age, that once pure and foolish idolisation ability disappears instantly."

Anyhow, the idol-makers of this era have mastered the objective law that "all young people have some years of ignorant, barren spirit, and solitude", deliver more targeted young fresh idols to every young people.

(Jenny and LIN Zi are fake names.)
