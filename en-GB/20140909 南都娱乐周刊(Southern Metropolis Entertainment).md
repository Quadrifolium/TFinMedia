"Do you know the King of Four?"
"Yes, LI Yi-feng(李易峰)'s girlfriends, HAN Han(韩寒)'s sons-in-law, WANG Si-cong(王思聪)'s wives, and TFBOYS's mums."
Such a weird answer which commonly appears recently makes TIAN Tian(田田), a 25-year-old director, exclaim "I couldn't follow the new generation's pace".
On 28th Aug., at the backstage of "Generation Show"(年代秀) of Shenzhen TV(深圳卫视), the three playful boys laughing at their succeeded trick are the members of TFBOYS

**GROWTH**
## How to Be TFBOYS

"The smallest continent is Oceania, not Antarctica."
WANG Jun-kai, who called himself a "Geo dab", pointed an error in the script to the director, TIAN Tian, easily.
YI Yang-qian-xi and WANG Yuan agreed with him.

The quiz and shows all went in predetermined process, with applauses and screams of "Clovers"(the fans of TFBOYS).
Executive producer MAO Jia(毛嘉) hadn't expected the appearance of child stars much before, but after reviewing the recordings, he found himself attracted by the three boys.
"They are well-trained, they have a fascination on stage, which is not the style of a super star I thought of.
It makes you filled with hope, it has a power of beauty and pureness.
And they are young, everything is possible for them."
The experienced producer said.

**Total Number of Fans Exceeds Ten Million**
### Birth of Teen Idol Group

"Qian-xi, keep smiling on the stage, don't keep your lips closed."
In the waiting room, the manager Yuna was tidying the costumes carefully and talking with them tenderly.
"WANG Yuan, don't open your legs when standing, don't forget the dance moves."
When they went back to the stage, Yuna sat before the monitor quietly, concentrated on the performance of the boys.
"Actually, I was still nervous before this shoot, but they are progressing." She said.

Date back to Aug. 2013, this group named TFBOYS, which means "The Fighting Boys", debuted with a short film called "Ten Years"
-- They made a ten-year promise with their fans: with ten-year's endeavour, they will finally reach their great future.

14-year-old Chongqing boy WANG Yuan was good at showmanship and singing.
"We are not very popular now," he told us,
"popular means that wherever you go, people there know you and your works.
But we are only popular in some circles.
To be known by everyone like Jay Chou, we should work hard for a long time."
That's true, "fame is a bubble," this was also what Yuna often said.

Among them, the leader WANG Jun-kai was the first to be selected by the agency "Time Fengjun".
As the only one born before millennium(born in 1999), he was sometimes joked at by the other two as an "old man".
YUAN Qi(袁琪), a director of "Day Day Up"(天天向上), told us, "WANG Jun-kai has a nature of being a star, you can tell the quality from the cover videos years ago."
The youngest member YI Yang-qian-xi was born in Hunan Hongjiang, and went to Beijing at two.
He was skilled at dance, magic show, "Bian Lian"(变脸, literally: "face-changing", a Chinese dramatic art of Sichuan opera), and so on. He was also a "xue ba"(学霸, one who's score ranks top in class or school) who once ranked the top at school, and the fans called him "Qian Zong"(千总, literally: "Boss Qian").
At the backstage, he was always playing his iPad, only after received a rigid fan printed with he and his younger brother from a fan did he start playing childishly.
"Qian-xi loves his brother very much," TIAN Tian said.

Three boys aged under fifteen, debuted less than a year, created several impressive records
-- the total number of fans exceeds ten million, and is increasing at the speed of 500,000 for each member per month;
one Weibo post of WANG Jun-kai talking about his exam was reposted 600,000 times;
the MV of "Magic Castle" broke the "complete play" record once kept by "Zui Xuan Minzu Feng"(最炫民族风, literally: "The Most Dazzling Folk Style") for many years;
China's top variety show "Happy Camp"(快乐大本营) customised their first TV show, of which a sculpted ticket priced 6,000 yuan;
the ticket of "Generation Show" even topped 30,000 yuan;
ZHANG Zi-yi(章子怡) nominated the three boys in the Ice Bucket Challenge...
A teen idol group made in China, which exceeds Japanese and Korean ones, was born.
Though the moment came three years earlier than what the agency expected.

**Nice Look, Good in Study, Positive Energy...**
### Their Attractions Really Work

Why are they attractive?
In this world of fancying looks, their pure and handsome looks are attractive.
"Four or five months ago, a team header Wan-di(婉笛) already liked them very much.
It was her who suggested inviting them."
CHE Yi-feng(车溢峰), the director of "Generation Show", said.

Doing well in school study -- this is what TFBOYS differs from Japanese and Korean teen groups, this is why there are so many sister fans and mum fans.
MAO Jia said, many teen groups abroad doesn't pay much attention on school study, there's a Korean group of which the members just learn singing, dancing, and languages from twelve,
"they didn't learn school courses for years, I think such an idol would be flimsy."
However, TF Family agreed with their parents that the school study won't be influenced.
"Not to simply choose one for singing and dancing, this sense is very good.
Because it should first conform to mainstream values, then the look and talent would be a plus, and finally release powerful energy."

CHE Yi-feng was the team leader of this episode of "Generation Show", his impression of TFBOYS was also positive -- real, pure, cute, and polite.
"They visited all other guests before the shoot.
On the stage, even domineering LI Xiang(李湘) treat them preferentially."
He remembered this clearly.

"They are fairly 'legitimate' in Chinese traditional view, everyone who have contact with them would like them."
YUAN Qi, a director of "Day Day Up" said, she was once puzzled about such a phenomenon, thought there should be "mercenaries", otherwise how could three boys without works and promotion be popular?
"Later, a friend from 'Happy Camp' told me, they were indeed doing homework at the backstage.
Generally, the script-checking was usually done in the guest's hotel room.
But the director could not get there that day, the boys went to the office instead, checked the script for several times.
Their pureness and hard-working won many directors' praise.
TIAN Tian even said in her Friend Circle that the whole team had become the boys' fans.

**PROMOTION**
## Can TFBOYS Be Replicated?

TFBOYS came, agitated the show biz, too many people knew little about the three shy boys' sudden popularity, and curiosity, puzzles, and disputes came
-- In a gala's rehearsal which TFBOYS attended, journalists saw loads of the boys' pictures in their Friend Circles, while many peers were taking their photos while doubting "why the boys are so popular".

"The youngest among those journalists are born in 1980s," MAO Jia said, "they are staying at the era of photo-reading of idols."
The era of photo-reading, in Korean's statement, is a time filled with exquisite posters and prints, that people see their idols as super stars high above the masses.
However, new media and we-media are invading print media, fans are able to get instant videos about the idol via the interaction with we-media, and be more "participated in".
Under such a thorough revolution in media did TFBOYS appeared as a semi-product, and it ignited the great passion of participation, cultivation, and sharing of joy.

"Clovers have a slogan which says 'with ten-year's companion, for the glory of coronation', the fans may feel ennobled on their success, consider themselves to be the big push."
MAO Jia explained, "Actually, the success of TFBOYS can be replicated, only had the sceptics been deigned to watch their Weibo posts and videos can they know the reason of their popularity."
Indeed, the new generation have no sense of one who's far removed.
To understand them, you should seize the core of fans economy -- fully affined involvement.

"In about two to three years, those doubts may disappear."
MAO Jia was quite confident of the future of TFBOYS.

### Q&A on TFBOYS's Popularity

**Q1:**
What is the agency "Time Fengjun" behind TF Family?  
**A1:**
According to the business credit website of BAIC(Beijing Administration for Industry and Commerce), "Time Fengjun" was found in 2009, was an S.M.E.(small and medium enterprise) with registered capital of 1 million yuan.
Its legal representatives were quite out of show biz, and it was initially a training agency of children's arts.
The brand "TF Family" was created in 2010, it recruits boy trainees for free training in singing, dancing, and performances starting from scratch, and evaluates them through music covers and self-made videos.
WANG Jun-kai joined TF Family in early 2011, WANG Yuan and YI Yang-qian-xi joined in 2012 and 2013, respectively.
According to the manager Yuna, the agency learns from the mode of Johnny & Associates of Japan, it recruits only boys, with no certain selection rate.
And it is still recruiting.

**Q2:**
How did TFBOYS become popular?  
**A2:**
New media & video sites(in 2011, the cover of "Yige Xiang Xiatian, Yige Xiang Qiutian"(一个像夏天，一个像秋天, literally: "One Likes Summer, One Likes Autumn") had been reposted by Christine Fan(范玮琪); in 2012, the cover of "Yangcong"(洋葱, onion) had been reposted by Ashin(阿信) of Mayday and broadcast on CTi TV(中天電視, Chung T'ien Television))  
→ "danmaku"(弹幕, overlaid comments on a video, derived from Japanese "弾幕") video site(self-made dramas and shows went hot on bilibili.com, the shipping between WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan was favoured by some fans)  
→ off-line events(attended Yinyuetai's award ceremony, its popularity gained widespread concern)  
→ traditional media(been reported by portal sites and mainstream media, attended hot variety shows and talk shows)

**Q3:**
Why are teenage boys more popular than idols in their early twenties?  
**A3:**
MAO Jia said, "in 2014, many young male entertainers debuted for years, like LI Yi-feng, William Chan(陈伟霆), and MA Tian-yu(马天宇), suddenly rose to fame, China's show biz are eager for fresh items."
For the boys, this is an advantageous slack market.
Besides, idols in their early twenties have an uncertainty,
"like Ko Chen-tung(柯震东), who was thought to be a clean idol with positive image, once some negative news came out, the influence would be fatal.
But boys don't have, the surroundings here won't led them to Justine Bieber."

**Q4:**
What's the quintessence of TFBOYS's popularity?  
**A4:**
The participation through the cultivation mode, the feeling of pity and the desire of protection caused by immature image and minor status, the preference and favour of shipping between good-looking boys, and the resurgence of young male idol groups like "Xiao Hu Dui"(小虎队, Little Tiger).
YUAN Qi deemed that the shyness and unease of TFBOYS on their first TV show in "Happy Camp" "made them adorable.
They are still pure and natural at the age, they are like boys next door, which make them beloved."
MAO Jia said that even the agency was somewhat diffident under the goodwill,
"they acted gingerly and carefully, aroused the kindness of the fans and our staff."

**Q:**
Then, how's Karry's nagging like?  
**J:**
Roy thinks he's nagging, but I think he's risible.
Once I was carrying a cat in my arms, and the cat ran away. Karry kept grinning aside, so hard that his eyes were almost closed, so long that he couldn't stop.
It's very silly.

**Round Table Meeting**
## Sustainable Development of TFBOYS

**MAO Jia(Executive director of "Generation Show" of Shenzhen TV)**

Remain sincere and modest, regardless of the popularity.
Because there are lessons drawn from others' mistakes.
But I can tell that the agency is quite clear.
Though exploring the market diffidently, the agency is clear to the boys' future, lays emphasis on their positive images.
The boys would bow in the hall to fans who couldn't get into the shooting site, if they remain such an attitude, they can progress further.

**ZOU Xiao-ying(邹小樱) (musician)**

Their team is daring and creative.
It's far from favouring for me, but they are always changing every time I met them.
Their expression is apprehensible -- like the hero in a comic who's defeating enemies and upgrading.
I was moved sometimes.
They have attended "Happy Camp", they are known by more mainstream media, they will be promoted in the next years.

**LI Qiao-hua(李俏华) (well-known fashion reviewer, producer)**

I've heard of them several times this year.
They are lively and cheerful boys, but not fashionable enough.
First, the boys are not differentiated enough in shapes, it's better to learn from western groups, which are not much unified.
Be natural, simple T-shirts and jeans can be youthful and vivid.
Add some accessories not garish or adult, be pure and fresh.
There's a great fashion market on 2000s, TFBOYS's popularity is high but the image is not fashionable, it's hard to be noticed by high-end brands.
In fact, they can be in light-fashion(轻时尚), F.M.C.G. like H&M or Gap suits them well.

**CULTIVATION** *[of Fans]*
## Post-1990s "weird aunties" and Post-1980s "grannies"

In 27th, Aug., at China National Convention Centre in Beijing, many fans in orange T-shirts were waiting outside.
There were too many people that the security had to be tightened.
They were here only because TFBOYS would attend an event here.
At that night, many journalists at Shenzhen airport were shocked by the crowded but orderly fans.
Back to 3rd Aug., an event scheduled in a mall in Beijing was halted due to the unexpected number of fans that exceeded the capacity of the mall.

Overcrowded fans appear in every activity with TFBOYS.
In this way do they show their presence, and renew the public's opinion that TFBOYS are SO popular.
The fans are named "Clovers" which derives from the lyrics of the song "HEART"
-- "Clovers will blossom in the future, now just be the ocean of flowers of mine."
Clovers are mostly girls aged between 1985 and 1999, who name themselves "auntie fans" or "mum fans", call TFBOYS their "sons" usually, sometimes treat them as brothers next door or boyfriends.

So many crazy fans swarmed in, were treated as weird, insane, or overdosed by some people.
Many were confused why a fresh group can have so many fans.

Actually, TFBOYS were popular on the web before their debut.
Some fans noticed these boys from 2012, "there's no TFBOYS at the time, I watched WANG Jun-kai's cover of 'Wode Gesheng Li'(我的歌声里, literally: "In My Song") unintentionally, I liked it and started paying attention to them.
Finally in 2013, I became a fan because of "Yangcong"(洋葱, Onion)." Xiao-qi said.
And Xiao-zuo also noticed them through covering videos.

Covering videos and training records before debut(some call it "the dark past") accumulated the first fans, and it's this situation that prompted the agency bringing the debut forward.
Some in show biz says, "the past offers the memory of their growth to the fans, it makes them more involved," which brings adherence and loyalty.
Xiao-qi had went to Chongqing from Beijing last October, just for the first signing.
TFBOYS was then only two months after debut, its popularity cannot be taken lightly.
"All five floors were filled with fans, some fans went there before the mall open while the event was in the afternoon."

Self-made variety shows are also important in attracting new fans and maintaining adherence.
This March, "TF Teens GO!" was released, though simple and crude without promotion of mainstream media, the number of fans still increased rapidly through the fans' spread on the web.
[A mistake. "TF Teens GO!" started from late 2013, "Study Room in Boys' School" was released this March.]
Pang-xie, Xiao-yu, and Xiao-luo became fans at that time "because of their natural, pure, and grounded performances in the shows."

On 15th Apr., TFBOYS carried out a counter-attack from the web to the off-line world.
Pang-xie remembered clearly that the scream of Clovers came from everywhere at the ceremony.
It was the first time that mainstream media and musicians know them. With the olive branch of "Happy Camp" and many activities in the summer, TFBOYS became more popular.
Pang-xie went to attend the shoot of "Happy Camp", sat in the second row from the farthest which cost 5,000 yuan.
"It's obvious that there are more fans after the ceremony and 'Happy Camp', so does the media's concern."

Exposing the training, this real cultivation won most fans' minds.
"They are real like my family, like brothers next door." Xiao-qi said.
While Xiao-xian thought they "are grounded, not untouchable stars, it's wonderful that they will do their homework after performances."
Xiao-xian is the leader of the fan club of TF Family, aged 29.
It would be beyond expectation that Xiao-xian is an "uncle fan".

Each member has his own fans, WANG Jun-kai's fans are named "Xiao Pangxie"(小螃蟹, literally: "Little Crabs"), WANG Yuan's "Xiao Tangyuan"(小汤圆, literally: "Little Tangyuan"), and YI Yang-qian-xi's "Qian Zhi He"(千纸鹤, literally: "Origami Cranes"). They have their own identity colours.
There are also Kai-Yuan gangs(shipping between WANG Jun-kai and WANG Yuan) and Qian-Wen gangs(shipping between YI Yang-qian-xi and LIU Zhi-hong, a trainee of TF Family).
Xiao-luo said, "I am a fan of the whole group, like WANG Jun-kai the most, as well as shipping.
But it's only in fandom(同人, どうじん) level, I won't emphasize it to them."

Besides, there are many local fan clubs like "Tianya Jiejie Tuan"(天涯姐姐团, literally: "Sister Community of Tianya Club"), which organises supporting activities in events.
When the boys are studying in school, the clubs have their own way of promotion. The fans raise funds for their activities together.
Take Yinyuetai's ceremony as an example, the activity cost over 4,0000 yuan, each one shared 20 equally.
Some fans also send gifts to their "sons".
Too many gifts were posted to the agency after their popularity, and there came a notice that expresses disapproval of gifts cost over 1,000 yuan, to avoid comparison.

Beijing Fan Club of TFBOYS consisted nearly 10,000 members, who also devoted to public weal in the name of the idols.
Xiao-xian said, "More people understand about them. Initially, many people didn't know them in our off-line activities.
After our introduction, most of them would be friendly.
In the beginning, we were treated as overdosed."
But following TFBOYS's popularity, there came controversies,
"I can't stand those intended rumours, slanders, and abuses, those totally fabricated things." Xiao-yu said.

Crazy "weird aunties".

Derivatives that are their source of income.

**PROFIT**

## A Photo Set Earned 3 Million Yuan

ZOU Xiao-ying knew TFBOYS last October, when it's planning the first E.P. with the release authorized to StarSing Disc(星外星唱片).
ZOU said the sale went well, to the level as Hebe Tien(田馥甄) and Yoga Lin(林宥嘉).

In the shrinking physical record market, the sale is a proof of its market value.
Besides, on Yinyuetai, currently the strictest on-line chart in China, the records TFBOYS created are proves of their popularity.
The MV of its latest single "The Manual of Youth"(青春修炼手册) keeps five records on the mainland China chart,
including 1,610,0000 times of "complete play" on site, 320,000 off site, 1,420,000 via mobile, 14,000 downloads, and 220,000 shares via mobile.
Still, it's sprinting for a grand slam of eight records.
And playing the MV for several times is a fan's daily work.

Its profit pattern is also different from tradition.
TFBOYS doesn't accept commercial performances, occasionally attend TV shows with general fees, and a few endorsements with activities.
It is said that one song or two on stage costs 500,000 yuan, but may practically be lower.

It's much similar to the pattern of Johnny & Associates of Japan -- profiting from membership services and commodities.
It opened official Fan Clubs on Yinyuetai, Weibo, and Baidu Tieba.
A membership of the Fan Club on Yinyuetai costs only 298 yuan per year, the member can have official ID card and passport, as well as exclusive ring-tones, mobile wallpapers, videos, and opportunities of chatting with idols.
Off-line events have reserved tickets for members.
The membership of the Fan Club on Weibo also costs 298 yuan per year, one can track updated schedules, browse exclusive photos, interact on-line, and participate in special talk shows.
Moreover, virtual flowers the fans bought will benefit them directly.
A flower costs 2 yuan, the fan can get 2 adoration points(爱慕值).
Up to now, TFBOYS received 33,110 flowers, the fan ranked the top of the adoration chart spent 3,344 yuan.
Yet, the membership of the Fan Club on Baidu Tieba is free, there are schedules published, and interactions at times.

TFBOYS has two Taobao shops officially, the commodities include albums, photo sets(生写真, なまじゃしん, photos without editing or modification in particular), stationery, pillows, wristbands, etc.
All things would be sold out in a short time.
The most popular products are the members' photo sets, each of which costs from 36 yuan(10 photos) to 118 yuan(30 photos), that limited to 30,000 sets each time.
But that's not enough.
The latest summer photo sets of WANG Jun-kai's got 21,399 orders in the first hour, all sets of WANG Yuan's were sold out in several hours.
The agency may earn over 1 million yuan on one new product, one set for each member may easily yield 3 million.
Adding others like T-shirts and stationery, the market value of TFBOYS is stunning.
