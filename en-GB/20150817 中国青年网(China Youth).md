On 14th August, "Sunny Posting" started, the appeal for civilised and rational commenting raised -- "When the rage is overweighted, don't have mouse and keyboard overtake your mind.
When counter-current flows, be bold in rejecting the thoughts.
For the present, and the future." This becomes the mutual aspiration of all the attendees.

"Sunny Posting" is an action guided by CAC and CYLC, hosted by New Media Association of China Youth(中国青少年新媒体协会), and promoted by news and Internet organisations such as xinhuanet.com(新华网, news.cn), people.cn(人民网), youth.cn(中国青年网), Tencent, Sina, NetEase, Sohu, Baidu, etc.

According to CNNIC, up to June 2015, there are 668 million netizens in China, among which 78.4% are aged 10 to 39, which is over 500 million.
The safety of the Internet environment they are in causes much concern.

Youth.cn had made a serial report titled "Purify cyberspace, wipe out violence, protect juveniles, promote righteousness", after interviewing several youths who had suffered from cyber violence, the journalists found that although unremitting efforts were made to improve the serenity of the cyberspace, filthy words, malicious search, and cyber violence still exists.
It is not only eroding the Internet environment, but also influencing juveniles' view of world, life, and value negatively.

Maintaining Internet safety, creating a civilised Internet, purifying the Internet environment, are extremely urgent, admit of no delay!


**"The web won't be dark once you are sunny."**

The disorder of commenting is always disturbing the Internet environment.

At the launching ceremony, Deputy director of CAC, REN Xian-liang, said, from the signing of "Letter of commitment on supervision and regulation of commenting" in November 2014, websites enhanced the legalised management of commenting, rational voices increased obviously, the disorder of commenting changed a lot.
"However, rumours, slanders, abuses, irrational venting, vulgar and erotic contents appear often, the regulation is far from being finished, more social strengths are needed.

At the ceremony, as the first ambassadors of the promotion of "Sunny Posting", teen idol group TFBOYS talked with REN Xian-liang, FU Zhen-bang, and JIN Dong, introduced "Voices of Juveniles" -- the social platform hosted by CYLC, and read out the proposal of the action.

"The web won't be dark once you are sunny.
The haze won't stay if you carry a breeze.
Only moving forward can we step over the barriers.
As netizens, we are all connected, we share joys and sorrows."
TFBOYS' voice aroused widespread resonance on the Internet.
The leader WANG Jun-kai expressed his opinion of using the Internet, and called for civilised actions, demanding appeals and rights through reasonable ways, and spreading positive energy.

"Juveniles are an important part of Internet actions, active participants of commenting, and forerunners of positive energy on the web.
I hope these young friends participate in the action, refuse rumours and violence steadily, keep away from filthy words, observe disciplines and obey laws, make civilised comments, spread positive energy, practise the core values of socialism, be volunteers of civilised cyberspace."


**Where noble prevails, there vanishes negativity**

In the time of omni-media, the maintaining of cyberspace requires involvements from all sectors of society, especially social media and young netizens.

At the ceremony, FU Zhen-bang said, the Internet society is not virtual but real, and it is difficult to separate the on-line and off-line world.
With the continuous development of the Internet, polarised feedbacks and the Internet monopoly will hugely impact the regulation.
He said, the Internet management should be reinforced to help juveniles to form the correct view of world, life, and value; while at the same time, expand the battle field on the Internet, reduce negative contents via increasing positive ones.

"I hope New Media Association of China Youth organise the activities of 'Sunny Posting' elaborately, improve the Internet environment effectively, to gain actual effect through actual activities.
I hope the youths respond the action positively and firmly;
all sectors of society pull together;
network security department, education department, and traditional media participate in, to push the action to cybercafé, campuses, and communities;
and the youths participate in." FU said, where noble prevails, there vanishes negativity.

LIANG Zhi(梁植), volunteer and youth orator, said, from the hotspot of "8.12" Tianjin Port accident, netizens have the basic quality of "repost in cautiousness", spreading positive energy is a practicable way.
"Most of the netizens are rational, only a few of them are not.
But this minority may mislead all the others.
In my opinion, 'Sunny Posting' means more thought and resistance when facing improper views."

LI You(李游), the member of the editorial board of Tencent as the delegate of Internet media, said, filtering and guiding comments with web techniques is far from sufficient for purifying the Internet environment, "netizens are users and participants of Internet products, are the real creators of positive contents.
If self-disciplined, they may share the serene cyberspace; or, if undisciplined and aggravating situations, they may fall into the mire, or even break the law."

"Under the support and guidance of CAC and CYLC, New Media Association of China Youth starts the action of 'Sunny Posting', aimed at calling upon young netizens to abandon bias and rage with positive and rational mind, regain mutual respect and tolerance;
proposing healthy Internet behaviour norms to bring positive words back to cyberspace, and drive vulgar words away; striking down vicious power to build a serene space;
prompting young netizens to practise the core values of socialism, spread positive energy, and be qualified netizens."
JIN Dong said, to organise the activities, the association will pour all efforts to gather positive energy, enhance the guidance of thought, form correct directions on the web, lead healthy growth of Chinese youths.

It is said that through a series of on-line and off-line events like open classes, micro dramas, micro video contest, debates in colleges, on-line interactions in campus, signing events, etc.,
"Sunny Posting" aims at focusing on rational commenting, avoiding cyber violence, identifying Internet rumours, reporting harmful information, improving the professional quality and public morality of Internet media;
advocating rational commenting and civilised posting, strengthening positive energy in Internet comments, improving the environment of commenting and reply, in the criterion of the core values of socialism;
to form favourable commenting atmosphere.
